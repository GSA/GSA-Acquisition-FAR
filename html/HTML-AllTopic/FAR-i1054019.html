As prescribed in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1090904.html#i1090904">25.1102</a>(c)(3), add the following definition of “Bahrainian, Mexican, or Omani construction material” to paragraph (a) of the basic clause, and substitute the following paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) for paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the basic clause:</p>
            <p class="p">“Bahrainian, Mexican, or Omani construction material” means a construction material that-</p>
            <p class="p List2">(1) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of Bahrain, Mexico, or Oman; or</p>
            <p class="p List2">(2) In the case of a construction material that consists in whole or in part of materials from another country, has been substantially transformed in Bahrain, Mexico, or Oman into a new and different construction material distinct from the materials from which it was transformed.</p>
            <p class="p List1">(b) Construction materials. (1) This clause implements <a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml;jsessionid=114A3287C7B3359E597506A31FC855B3" target="_blank">41 U.S.C. chapter 83</a>, by providing a preference for domestic construction material. In accordance with <a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml;jsessionid=114A3287C7B3359E597506A31FC855B3" target="_blank">41 U.S.C. 1907</a>, the component test of the Buy American statute is waived for construction material that is a COTS item. (See FAR <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1112949.html#i1112949">12.505</a>(a)(2)). In addition, the Contracting Officer has determined that the WTO GPA and all the Free Trade Agreements except the Bahrain FTA, NAFTA, and the Oman FTA apply to the this acquisition. Therefore, the Buy American statute restrictions are waived for designated country construction materials other than Bahrainian, Mexican, or Omani construction materials.</p>
            <p class="p List2">(2) The Contractor shall use only domestic or designated country construction material other than Bahrainian, Mexican, or Omani construction material in performing this contract, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this clause.</p>
