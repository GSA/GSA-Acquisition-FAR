                  When a contractor debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment is proposed as a subcontractor for any subcontract subject to Government consent (see <a class="xref fm:Subpart" href="FAR-i1073536.html#i1073536">subpart&nbsp; 44.2</a>), contracting officers shall not consent to subcontracts with such contractors unless the agency head states in writing the compelling reasons for this approval action. (See <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1115236.html#i1115236">9.405</a>(b) concerning declarations of ineligibility affecting sub-contracting.)</p>

                  The Government suspends or debars contractors to protect the Government’s interests. By operation of the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1062590.html#i1062590">52.209-6</a>, Protecting the Government’s Interests When Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended or Proposed for Debarment, contractors shall not enter into any subcontract in excess of $35,000, other than a subcontract for a commercially available off-the-shelf item, with a contractor that has been debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment unless there is a compelling reason to do so. If a contractor intends to enter into a subcontract in excess of $35,000, other than a subcontract for a commercially available off-the-shelf item, with a party that is debarred, suspended, or proposed for debarment as evidenced by the party's having an active exclusion record in SAM (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1115204.html#i1115204">9.404</a>), a corporate officer or designee of the contractor is required by operation of the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1062590.html#i1062590">52.209-6</a>, Protecting the Government’s Interests when Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment, to notify the contracting officer, in writing, before entering into such subcontract. For contracts for the acquisition of commercial items, the notification requirement applies only for first-tier subcontracts. For all other contracts, the notification requirement applies to subcontracts at any tier. The notice must provide the following:</p>
