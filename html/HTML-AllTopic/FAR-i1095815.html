of a product on the List is not a bar to purchase of any such product mined,
produced, or manufactured in the identified country, but rather
is an alert that there is a reasonable basis to believe that such
product may have been mined, produced, or  manufactured <em class="ph i">test</em> by
forced or indentured child  labor.</p>
