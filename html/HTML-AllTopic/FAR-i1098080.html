If the contracting officer believes a violation exists (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1098033.html#i1098033">22.406-8</a>), or upon request of the Department of Labor, the contracting officer must withhold from payments due the contractor an amount equal to the estimated wage underpayment and estimated liquidated damages due the United States under the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards statute. (See <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1098313.html#i1098313">22.302</a>.)</p>

                        If the contracting officer believes a violation exists or upon request of the Department of Labor, the contracting officer must withhold funds from any current Federal contract or Federally assisted contract with the same prime contractor that is subject to either Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute or Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards statute requirements.</p>

                        If a subsequent investigation confirms violations, the contracting officer must adjust the withholding as necessary.

If a contractor or subcontractor fails or refuses to comply with the labor standards clauses of the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute and related statutes, the agency, upon its own action or upon the written request of the Department of Labor, must suspend any further payment, advance, or guarantee of funds until the violations cease or until the agency has withheld sufficient funds to compensate employees for back wages, and to cover any liquidated damages due.</p>
