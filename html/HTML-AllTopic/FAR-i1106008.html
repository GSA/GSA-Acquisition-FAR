                        The contractorâ€™s format for submitting the data should be used (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1106106.html#i1106106">15.403-5</a>(b)(2)).</p>

                        The contracting officer shall ensure that data used to support price negotiations are sufficiently current to permit negotiation of a fair and reasonable price.

                        As specified in section 808 of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Pub. L. 105-261), an offeror who does not comply with a requirement to submit data for a contract or subcontract in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this subsection is ineligible for award unless the HCA determines that it is in the best interest of the Government to make the award to that offeror, based on consideration of the following:</p>

                  Adequate price competition. When adequate price competition exists (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1105936.html#i1105936">15.403-1</a>(c)(1)), generally no additional data are necessary to determine the reasonableness of price. However, if there are unusual circumstances where it is concluded that additional data are necessary to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall, to the maximum extent practicable, obtain the additional data from sources other than the offeror. In addition, the contracting officer should request data to determine the cost realism of competing offers or to evaluate competing approaches.</p>

                        At a minimum, the contracting officer must use price analysis to determine whether the price is fair and reasonable whenever the contracting officer acquires a commercial item (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1106135.html#i1106135">15.404-1</a>(b)). The fact that a price is included in a catalog does not, in and of itself, make it fair and reasonable. If the contracting officer cannot determine whether an offered price is fair and reasonable, even after obtaining additional data from sources other than the offeror, then the contracting officer shall require the offeror to submit data other than certified cost or pricing data to support further analysis (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1106135.html#i1106135">15.404-1</a>). This data may include history of sales to non-governmental and governmental entities, cost data, or any other information the contracting officer requires to determine the price is fair and reasonable. Unless an exception under <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1105936.html#i1105936">15.403-1</a>(b)(1) or (2) applies, the contracting officer shall require that the data submitted by the offeror include, at a minimum, appropriate data on the prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold, adequate for determining the reasonableness of the price.</p>
