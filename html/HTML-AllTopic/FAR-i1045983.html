                        It may be advantageous to the offeror to submit f.o.b. origin prices that include only the lowest cost to the Contractor for loading of shipment at the Contractor’s plant or most favorable shipping point. The cost beyond that plant or point of bringing the supplies to the place of delivery and the cost of loading, blocking, and bracing on the type vehicle specified by the Government at the time of shipment may exceed the offeror’s lowest cost when the offeror ships for the offeror’s account. Accordingly, the offeror may indicate differentials that may be added to the offered price. These differentials shall be expressed as a rate in cents for each 100 pounds (CWT) of the supplies for one or more of the options under this clause that the Government may specify at the time of shipment.</p>

                        These differential(s) will be considered in the evaluation of offers to determine the lowest overall cost to the Government. If, at the time of shipment, the Government specifies a mode of transportation, type of vehicle, or place of delivery for which the offeror has set forth a differential, the Contractor shall include the total of such differential costs (the applicable differential multiplied by the actual weight) as a separate reimbursable item on the Contractor’s invoice for the supplies.</p>
