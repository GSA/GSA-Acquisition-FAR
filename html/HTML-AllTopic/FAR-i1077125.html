                  This section implements <a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml;jsessionid=114A3287C7B3359E597506A31FC855B3" target="_blank">41 U.S.C. 2308</a>. Modular contracting is intended to reduce program risk and to incentivize contractor performance while meeting the Government’s need for timely access to rapidly changing technology. Consistent with the agency’s information technology architecture, agencies should, to the maximum extent practicable, use modular contracting to acquire major systems (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1125359.html#i1125359">2.101</a>) of information technology. Agencies may also use modular contracting to acquire non-major systems of information technology.</p>

                  When using modular contracting, an acquisition of a system of information technology may be divided into several smaller acquisition increments that-</p>

                        Provide for delivery, implementation, and testing of workable systems or solutions in discrete increments, each of which comprises a system or solution that is not dependent on any subsequent increment in order to perform its principal functions;</p>

                        Reduce risk of potential adverse consequences on the overall project by isolating and avoiding custom-designed components of the system.</p>

                  <span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span>
                  The characteristics of an increment may vary depending upon the type of information technology being acquired and the nature of the system being developed. The following factors may be considered:</p>
               <ol class="ol" type="a" id="i1077125__d2419e95">
                  <li class="li">
                     <p class="p" id="i1077125__d2437e99">
                        <span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span>
                        To promote compatibility, the information technology acquired through modular contracting for each increment should comply with common or commercially acceptable information technology standards when available and appropriate, and shall conform to the agency’s master information technology architecture.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="li">
                     <p class="p" id="i1077125__d2437e108">
                        <span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>
                        The performance requirements of each increment should be consistent with the performance requirements of the completed, overall system within which the information technology will function and should address interface requirements with succeeding increments.</p>
                  </li>
               </ol>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
               <p class="p" id="i1077125__d2437e119">
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span>
                  For each increment, contracting officers shall choose an appropriate contracting technique that facilitates the acquisition of subsequent increments. Pursuant to <a class="xref fm:Parts" href="FAR-i1105247.html#i1105247">parts&nbsp; 16</a> and <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1103434.html#i1103434">17</a> of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, contracting officers shall select the contract type and method appropriate to the circumstances (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts, single contract with options, successive contracts, multiple awards, task order contracts). Contract(s) shall be structured to ensure that the Government is not required to procure additional increments.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
               <p class="p" id="i1077125__d2437e137">
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span>
                  To avoid obsolescence, a modular contract for information technology should, to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded within 180 days after the date on which the solicitation is issued. If award cannot be made within 180 days, agencies should consider cancellation of the solicitation in accordance with <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1110862.html#i1110862">14.209</a> or <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i15_206.html#i15_206">15.206</a>(e). To the maximum extent practicable, deliveries under the contract should be scheduled to occur within 18 months after issuance of the solicitation.</p>
