         <p class="p List1">(a) Mentor firms will be solely responsible for selecting protege firms that qualify under I-102(b). Mentor firms are encouraged to identify and select concerns that have not previously received significant prime contract awards from DoD or any other Federal agency.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The selection of protege firms by mentor firms may not be protested, except as in paragraph (c) of this section.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) In the event of a protest regarding the size or disadvantaged status of an entity selected to be a protege firm, the mentor firm must refer the protest to the SBA to resolve in accordance with 13 CFR Part 121 (with respect to size) or 13 CFR Part 124 (with respect to disadvantaged status).</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) For purposes of the Small Business Act, no determination of affiliation or control (either direct or indirect) may be found between a protege firm and its mentor firm on the basis that the mentor firm has agreed to furnish (or has furnished) to its protege firm, pursuant to a mentor-protege agreement, any form of developmental assistance described in I-106(d).</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) A protege firm may not be a party to more than one DoD mentor-protege agreement at a time, and may only participate in the Program during the 5-year period beginning on the date the protege firm enters into its first mentor-protege agreement.</p>
