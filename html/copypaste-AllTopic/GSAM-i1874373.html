                         The inspection system maintained
by the Contractor under the Inspection of Supplies—Fixed Price clause
(FAR 52.246-2) of this contract shall be maintained throughout the
contract period. Unless otherwise authorized in writing by the Contracting
Officer, the Contractor shall comply with all requirements of editions
in effect on the date of the solicitation of either Federal Standard
368 or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
Standard 9001:2000 (Quality Management Systems—Requirements). A
documented description of the inspection system shall be made available
to the Government before contract award. At the sole discretion
of the Contracting Officer, he/she may authorize in writing exceptions
to the quality assurance standards identified above. The Contractor
shall immediately notify the Administrative Contracting Officer
(ACO) of any changes made in the inspection system during the contract
period. As used herein, the term “inspection system” means the Contractor’s
own facility or any other facility acceptable to the Government
that will be used to perform inspections or tests of materials and
components before incorporation into end articles and for inspection
of such end articles before shipment. When the manufacturing plant
is located outside of the United States, the Contractor shall arrange
delivery of the items from a plant or warehouse located in the United
States (including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) equipped
to perform all inspections and tests required by the contract or
specifications to evidence conformance therewith, or shall arrange
with a testing laboratory or other facility in the United States,
acceptable to the Government, to perform the required inspections
and tests.</p>

testing were performed. These records shall be available for (i) 3
years after final payment; or (ii) 4 years from the end of the Contractor’s
fiscal year in which the record was created, whichever period expires
first.</p>

notifies the Contractor of its intent to inspect supplies before
shipment, the Contractor shall notify or arrange for subcontractors

repaired, or otherwise corrected by the Contractor at no cost to
the Government within 30 calendar days (or such longer period as
the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt
of notice to replace or correct. The Contractor shall remove, at
its own expense, supplies rejected or required to be replaced, repaired,
or corrected. When the nature of the defect affects an entire batch or
lot of supplies, and the Contracting Officer determines that correction
can best be accomplished by retaining the nonconforming supplies,
and reducing the contract price by an equitable amount under the
circumstances, then the equitable price adjustment shall apply to
the entire batch or lot of supplies from which the nonconforming
item was taken.</p>
