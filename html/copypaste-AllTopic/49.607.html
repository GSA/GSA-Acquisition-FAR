                  <em class="ph i">Cure notice.</em> If a contract is to be terminated for default before the delivery date, a "Cure Notice" is required by the Default clause. Before using this notice, it must be ascertained that an amount of time equal to or greater than the period of "cure" remains in the contract delivery schedule or any extension to it. If the time remaining in the contract delivery schedule is not sufficient to permit a realistic "cure" period of 10 days or more, the "Cure Notice" should not be issued. The "Cure Notice" may be in the following format:</p>
               <p class=" ListL1" id="FAR_49_607__d2978e24">Cure Notice</p>
               <p class=" ListL1" id="FAR_49_607__d2978e26">You are notified that the Government considers your ____ [<em class="ph i">specify the contractor’s failure or failures</em>] a condition that is endangering performance of the contract. Therefore, unless this condition is cured within 10 days after receipt of this notice [<em class="ph i">or insert any longer time that the Contracting Officer may consider reasonably necessary</em>], the Government may terminate for default under the terms and conditions of the _______ [<em class="ph i">insert clause title</em>] clause of this contract.</p>

Pending a final decision in this matter, it will be necessary to determine whether your failure to perform arose from causes beyond your control and without fault or negligence on your part. Accordingly, you are given the opportunity to present, in writing, any facts bearing on the question to ____ [<em class="ph i">insert the name and complete address of the contracting officer</em>], within 10 days after receipt of this notice. Your failure to present any excuses within this time may be considered as an admission that none exist.
