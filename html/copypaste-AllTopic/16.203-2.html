         <p class="p" id="FAR_16_203_2__d987e8">A fixed-price contract with economic price adjustment may be used when (i) there is serious doubt concerning the stability of market or labor conditions that will exist during an extended period of contract performance, and (ii) contingencies that would otherwise be included in the contract price can be identified and covered separately in the contract. Price adjustments based on established prices should normally be restricted to industry-wide contingencies. Price adjustments based on labor and material costs should be limited to contingencies beyond the contractorâ€™s control. For use of economic price adjustment in sealed bid contracts, see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="14.408-4.html#FAR_14_408_4">14.408-4</a>.</p>

						            In establishing the base level from which adjustment will be made, the contracting officer shall ensure that contingency allowances are not duplicated by inclusion in both the base price and the adjustment requested by the contractor under economic price adjustment clause.</p>
