						             The SBA may not accept for negotiation a sole-source 8(a) contract that exceeds 
							$25 million
						 unless the requesting agency has completed a justification in accordance with the requirements of <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="6.303.html#FAR_6_303">6.303</a>.</p>

						             The SBA is responsible for initiating negotiations with the agency within the time established by the agency. If the SBA does not initiate negotiations within the agreed time and the agency cannot allow additional time, the agency may, after notifying the SBA, proceed with the acquisition from other sources.</p>

                  <span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span>
						             The SBA should participate, whenever practicable, in negotiating the contracting terms. When mutually agreeable, the SBA may authorize the contracting officer to negotiate directly with the 8(a) participant. Whether or not direct negotiations take place, the SBA is responsible for approving the resulting contract before award.</p>
