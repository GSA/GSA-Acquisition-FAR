         <p class="p List1">(a)  The Supplier Performance Risk System (SPSR) application </p>
         <p class="p">(https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil) will be used in the evaluation of suppliers’ past performance in accordance with DFARS <span class="ph DFARxref">
               <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="213.106-2.html#DFARS-213.106-2">213.106-2</a>
            </span>(b)(i).</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b)  SPRS collects quality and delivery data on previously awarded contracts and orders from existing Department of Defense reporting systems to classify each supplier’s performance history by Federal supply class (FSC) and product or service code (PSC).  The SPRS application provides the contracting officer quantifiable past performance information regarding a supplier's quality and delivery performance for the FSC and PSC of the supplies being purchased.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c)  The quality and delivery classifications identified for a supplier in SPRS will be used by the contracting officer to evaluate a supplier’s past performance in conjunction with the supplier’s references (if requested) and other provisions of this solicitation under the past performance evaluation factor.  The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quotation or offer represents the best value to the Government.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d)  SPRS classifications are generated monthly for each contractor and can be reviewed by following the access instructions in the SPRS User’s Manual found at 1ttps://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/reference.htm.  Contractors are granted access to SPRS for their own classifications only.  Suppliers are encouraged to review their own classifications, the SPRS reporting procedures and classification methodology detailed in the SPRS User's Manual, and SPRS Evaluation Criteria available from the references at https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/pdf/SPRS_DataEvaluationCriteria.pdf.  The method to challenge a rating generated by SPRS is provided in the User’s Manual.</p>
