shall be prepared at least annually and at the time the work under
a contract or order is completed. Past performance evaluations are
required for contracts and orders as specified in paragraphs (b)
through (f) of this section, including contracts and orders performed
outside the United States. These evaluations are generally for the
entity, division, or unit that performed the contract or order.
Past performance information shall be entered into CPARS, the Governmentwide
evaluation reporting tool for all past performance reports on contracts
and orders. Instructions for submitting evaluations into CPARS are
available at <a class="xref" href="http://www.cpars.gov/" target="_blank">http://www.cpars.gov/</a>.</p>

Except as provided in paragraphs (e), (f), and (h) of this section,
agencies shall prepare evaluations of contractor performance for
each contract (as defined in FAR <a class="xref fm:Part" href="Part_2.html#FAR_Part_2">part&nbsp; 2</a>)
that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold and for each order
that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. Agencies are
required to prepare an evaluation if a modification to the contract
causes the dollar amount to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>

                  <span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Orders
under multiple-agency contracts. Agencies shall prepare an evaluation
of contractor performance for each order that exceeds the simplified
acquisition threshold that is placed under a Federal Supply Schedule
contract or placed under a task-order contract or a delivery-order
contract awarded by another agency (<em class="ph i">i.e.</em>, Governmentwide acquisition
contract or multi-agency contract). Agencies placing orders under
their own multiple-agency contract shall also prepare evaluations
for their own orders. This evaluation shall not consider the requirements
under paragraph (g) of this section. Agencies are required to prepare
an evaluation if a modification to the order causes the dollar amount
to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>

                  <span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> Orders
under single-agency contracts. For single-agency task-order and
delivery-order contracts, the contracting officer may require performance
evaluations for each order in excess of the simplified acquisition
threshold when such evaluations would produce more useful past performance
information for source selection officials than that contained in
the overall contract evaluation (e.g., when the scope of the basic
contract is very broad and the nature of individual orders could
be significantly different). This evaluation need not consider the
requirements under paragraph (g) of this section unless the contracting
officer deems it appropriate.</p>
