                   General. Past performance evaluations
shall be prepared at least annually and at the time the work under
a contract or order is completed. Past performance evaluations are
required for contracts and orders as specified in paragraphs (b) through
(f) of this section, including contracts and orders performed outside
the United States. These evaluations are generally for the entity,
division, or unit that performed the contract or order. Past performance
information shall be entered into CPARS, the Governmentwide evaluation
reporting tool for all past performance reports on contracts and
orders. Instructions for submitting evaluations into CPARS are available
at <a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml;jsessionid=114A3287C7B3359E597506A31FC855B3" target="_blank">http://www.cpars.gov/</a>.</p>

                   Contracts.
Except as provided in paragraphs (e), (f), and (h) of this section,
agencies shall prepare evaluations of contractor performance for
each contract (as defined in FAR <a class="xref fm:Part" href="Part_2.html#FAR_Part_2">part&nbsp; 2</a>)
that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold and for each order
that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. Agencies are
required to prepare an evaluation if a modification to the contract
causes the dollar amount to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>

                  <span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span>
                   Orders
under multiple-agency contracts. Agencies shall prepare an evaluation
of contractor performance for each order that exceeds the simplified
acquisition threshold that is placed under a Federal Supply Schedule
contract or placed under a task-order contract or a delivery-order
contract awarded by another agency (<em class="ph i">i.e.</em>, Governmentwide
acquisition contract or multi-agency contract). Agencies placing
orders under their own multiple-agency contract shall also prepare
evaluations for their own orders. This evaluation shall not consider
the requirements under paragraph (g) of this section. Agencies are required
to prepare an evaluation if a modification to the order causes the
dollar amount to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>

                  <span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span>
                   Orders
under single-agency contracts. For single-agency task-order and
delivery-order contracts, the contracting officer may require performance
evaluations for each order in excess of the simplified acquisition
threshold when such evaluations would produce more useful past performance
information for source selection officials than that contained in
the overall contract evaluation (e.g., when the scope of the basic
contract is very broad and the nature of individual orders could
be significantly different). This evaluation need not consider the
requirements under paragraph (g) of this section unless the contracting
officer deems it appropriate.</p>

                   Past performance
evaluations shall be prepared for each construction contract of $750,000 or more, and
for each construction contract terminated for default regardless
of contract value. Past performance evaluations may also be prepared for
construction contracts below $750,000.
