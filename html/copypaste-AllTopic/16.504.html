of supplies or services during a fixed period. The Government places
orders for individual requirements. Quantity limits may be stated
as number of units or as dollar values.</p>

must require the Government to order and the contractor to furnish
at least a stated minimum quantity of supplies or services. In addition,
if ordered, the contractor must furnish any additional quantities,
not to exceed the stated maximum. The contracting officer should
establish a reasonable maximum quantity based on market research, trends
on recent contracts for similar supplies or services, survey of
potential users, or any other rational basis.</p>

Contracting officers may use an indefinite-quantity contract when
the Government cannot predetermine, above a specified minimum, the
precise quantities of supplies or services that the Government will
require during the contract period, and it is inadvisable for the
Government to commit itself for more than a minimum quantity. The
contracting officer should use an indefinite-quantity contract only
when a recurring need is anticipated.</p>
