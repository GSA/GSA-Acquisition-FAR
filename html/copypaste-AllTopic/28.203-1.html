for all types of bonds except position schedule bonds. Assets pledged
by an individual surety shall meet the eligibility requirements
of Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Per 31 U.S.C. 9310,
individual sureties must pledge eligible obligations, which Treasury
refers to as acceptable collateral or eligible collateral. A list
of acceptable assets, entitled “Acceptable Collateral for 31 CFR
part 225,” may be accessed by going to <a class="xref" href="https://www.treasurydirect.gov/%E2%80%8Binstit/%E2%80%8Bstatreg/%E2%80%8Bcollateral/%E2%80%8Bcollateral.htm" target="_blank">https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/statreg/collateral/collateral.htm</a> and

at 888-568-7343, of the individual surety, the assets to be pledged,
and the amount necessary to cover the individual surety bond, <em class="ph i">i.e.</em>,
the required amount to be collateralized. Treasury will advise the
contracting officer whether the assets are eligible to be pledged,
consistent with <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#FAR_28_203_1">28.203-1</a>(a), and of the
valuation of the assets offered to be pledged, consistent with the
valuation standards in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#FAR_28_203_1">28.203-1</a>(b)(2). If after
3 business days the contracting officer has not received a response
from Treasury, the contracting officer may seek assistance from
the Director, Bank Policy and Oversight, at 202-504-3502. The contracting
officer shall determine whether the individual surety bond is acceptable
as to the amount necessary to cover the individual surety bond based
on the asset eligibility and valuation assessment from Treasury.
The contracting officer shall notify both the offeror or contractor
and the individual surety of this determination.</p>
