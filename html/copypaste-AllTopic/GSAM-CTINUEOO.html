						            HCAs are directed to take appropriate steps to ensure that physically completed contracts are formally closed in accordance with the procedures at FAR 4.804, GSAM <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="GSAM-CTINUEOO.html#CTINUEOO">504.804-5</a>, and guidelines provided below for simplified acquisitions and contracts with residual balances. HCAs are reminded that when closing out contract actions at FAR 4.804-1(a)(2), (3), and (4), the contracting officer shall use the closeout procedures at FAR 4.804-5. However, these closeout actions may be modified to reflect the extent of administration that has been performed. Contracting activities that have supplemented the FAR procedures with instructions pertinent to the specific contract types, business systems, and resources employed are encouraged to continue the use of such supplements.</p>

						            &nbsp;Contracting officers must be vigilant and proactive with respect to proper contract closeout procedures. They must not allow completed contracts to remain open indefinitely or allow a failure to conduct timely closeout to violate regulatory or statutory requirements, or negatively impact GSAs accurate and timely financial reporting.</p>

						            Under FAR 4.804-1(a)(1), the contracting officer only needs evidence of receipt of goods and services and final payment to closeout the contract files. For contracts awarded under the simplified acquisition procedures, contracting officers shall ensure that the contract award document and the statement of work includes the following statement:</p>
					          <p class="p"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>“For payment purposes, the contractor shall mark its final invoice for payment as Final Invoice for Payment.”</p>
