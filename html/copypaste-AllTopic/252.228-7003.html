         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Found to be missing from his or her place of employment under circumstances that make it appear probable that the absence is due to the action of the force of any power not allied with the United States in a common military effort; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  Known to have been taken prisoner, hostage, or otherwise detained by the force of such power, whether or not actually engaged in employment at the time of capture; provided, that at the time of capture or detention, the person was either—</p>

         <p class="p List2">(2)  A “period of detention” begins with the day of capture and continues until the captured person is returned to the place of employment, the United States, or is able to be returned to the jurisdiction of the United States, or until the person's death is established or legally presumed to have occurred by evidence satisfactory to the Contracting Officer, whichever occurs first.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  “United States” comprises geographically the 50 states and the District of Columbia.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(d)  The obligation of the Government shall apply to the entire period of detention, except that it is subject to the availability of funds from which payment can be made.  The rights and obligations of the parties under this clause shall survive prior expiration, completion, or termination of this contract.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e)	The Contractor shall not be reimbursed under this clause for payments made if the employees were entitled to compensation for capture and detention under the War Hazards Compensation Act, as amended.</p>
