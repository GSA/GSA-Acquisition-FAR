								                 The contracting officer may, when contracting by negotiation, insert in solicitations and contracts a clause substantially the same as the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="52.219-10.html#FAR_52_219_10">52.219-10</a>, Incentive Subcontracting Program, when a subcontracting plan is required (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="19.702.html#FAR_19_702">19.702</a>), and inclusion of a monetary incentive is, in the judgment of the contracting officer, necessary to increase subcontracting opportunities for small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns, and is commensurate with the efficient and economical performance of the contract; unless the conditions in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are applicable. The contracting officer may vary the terms of the clause as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p>

								                 Various approaches may be used in the development of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns’ subcontracting incentives. They can take many forms, from a fully quantified schedule of payments based on actual subcontract achievement to an award-fee approach employing subjective evaluation criteria (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section). The incentive should not reward the contractor for results other than those that are attributable to the contractor’s efforts under the incentive subcontracting program.</p>

                        <span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span>
								                 As specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the contracting officer may include small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business subcontracting as one of the factors to be considered in determining the award fee in a cost-plus-award-fee contract; in such cases, however, the contracting officer shall not use the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="52.219-10.html#FAR_52_219_10">52.219-10</a>, Incentive Subcontracting Program.</p>
