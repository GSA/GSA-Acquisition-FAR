         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Indicate a specific time or subsequent event by which the contractor will submit a supplemental proposal, including certified cost or pricing data, identifying the cost impact adjustment necessitated by the deficient purchasing system;</p>

         <p class="p List3">(iv)  Provide that failure of the Government and the contractor to agree to the price adjustment shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause.</p>
