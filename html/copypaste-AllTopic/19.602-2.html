         <p class="p">Within 15 business days (or a longer period agreed to by the SBA and the contracting agency) after receiving a notice that a small business concern lacks certain elements of responsibility, the SBA Area Office will take the following actions:</p>
         
            
               <p class=" ListL1" id="FAR_19_602_2__d1207e12">
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span>
						            Inform the small business concern of the contracting officer’s determination and offer it an opportunity to apply to the SBA for a COC. (A concern wishing to apply for a COC should notify the SBA Area Office serving the geographical area in which the headquarters of the offeror is located.)</p>

                  <span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span>
						            Upon timely receipt of a complete and acceptable application, elect to visit the applicant’s facility to review its responsibility.</p>

								                The COC review process is not limited to the areas of nonresponsibility cited by the contracting officer.</p>

								                The SBA may, at its discretion, independently evaluate the COC applicant for all elements of responsibility, but may presume responsibility exists as to elements other than those cited as deficient.</p>

						            When the Area Director determines that a COC is warranted (for contracts valued at $25,000,000 or less), notify the contracting officer and provide the following options:</p>
               
                  
                     <p class=" ListL2" id="FAR_19_602_2__d1207e44">
                        <span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span>
								                Accept the Area Director’s decision to issue a COC and award the contract to the concern. The COC issuance letter will then be sent, including as an attachment a detailed rationale for the decision; or</p>
                  
                  
                     <p class=" ListL2" id="FAR_19_602_2__d1207e49">
                        <span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>

                              <span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span>
										                    To permit the SBA to forward a detailed rationale for the decision to the contracting officer for review within a specified period of time.</p>

                              <span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span>
										                    To submit any information to the SBA Area Office that the contracting officer believes the SBA did not consider (at which time, the SBA Area Office will establish a new suspense date mutually agreeable to the contracting officer and the SBA).</p>

										                    To permit resolution of an appeal by the contracting agency to SBA Headquarters under <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="19.602-3.html#FAR_19_602_3">19.602-3</a>. However, there is no contracting officer’s appeal when the Area Office proposes to issue a COC valued at $100,000 or less.</p>
