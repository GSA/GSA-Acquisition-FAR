or a Federal agency, e.g., GSA, may be used in unusual or compelling
circumstances, as determined by the contracting officer to be in
the best interest of the Government, and provided DLA Disposition
Services/the agency agrees. In such cases, disposal/sales services
may be provided on a reimbursable basis, with any sale proceeds
credited in compliance with <span class="ph FARxref">FAR
45.604-4</span>, Proceeds from sales of surplus property. If sale
services are needed, the plant clearance officer will document the
reasons in the case file and make arrangements directly with DLA
Disposition Services, GSA, other Federal agency, or third-party.
The arrangements will include a requirement to return all proceeds
to the plant clearance officer for crediting in compliance with <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 45.604-4</span>.</p>

information, see FED LOG or WEBFLIS at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/webflis/
and the current edition of the DoD Demilitarization Manual at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Consult with the DoD Demilitarization
(Demil)/Trade Security Control (TSC) Program office to determine
if the contractor inventory can be sold to the public; and if a
TSC assessment of the prospective buyer is required. Reference DoD
Instruction 2030.08, Implementation of Trade Security Controls (TSC)
for Transfers of DoD U.S. Munitions List (USML) and Commerce Control
List (CCL) Personal Property to Parties Outside DoD Control; and Defense
Demilitarization Manual, DoD 4160.28-M;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) If TSC is required, provide the DoD
Demil/TSC Program office with a completed DLA Form 1822 End-Use
Certificate (EUC) for the prospective buyer. Note: TSC assessments/EUCs
are typically not required for scrap sales; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) Upon TSC clearance (if required) of
the prospective buyer, authorize the contractor to complete the
sale, as applicable.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(13) To the extent that demilitarization,

a notice of proposed surplus sale to FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov)
if the items have potentially high public interest.</p>
