         <p class="p List2">(1)  “Computer data base” means a collection of data recorded in a form capable of being processed by a computer.  The term does not include computer software.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  “Computer program” means a set of instructions, rules, or routines recorded in a form that is capable of causing a computer to perform a specific operation or series of operations.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  “Computer software” means computer programs, source code, source code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms, processes, flow charts, formulae and related material that would enable the software to be reproduced, recreated, or recompiled.  Computer software does not include computer data bases or computer software documentation.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4)  “Computer software documentation” means owner's manuals, user's manuals, installation instructions, operating instructions, and other similar items, regardless of storage medium, that explain the capabilities of the computer software or provide instructions for using the software.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5)  "Covered Government support contractor" means a contractor (other than a litigation support contractor covered by <span class="ph DFARxref">
               <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="252.204-7014.html#DFARS-252.204-7014">252.204-7014</a>
            </span>) under a contract, the primary purpose of which is to furnish independent and impartial advice or technical assistance directly to the Government in support of the Government’s management and oversight of a program or effort (rather than to directly furnish an end item or service to accomplish a program or effort), provided that the contractor—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  Is not affiliated with the prime contractor or a first-tier subcontractor on the program or effort, or with any direct competitor of such prime contractor or any such first-tier subcontractor in furnishing end items or services of the type developed or produced on the program or effort; and</p>

         <p class="p List2">(6)  “Detailed manufacturing or process data” means technical data that describe the steps, sequences, and conditions of manufacturing, processing or assembly used by the manufacturer to produce an item or component or to perform a process.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7)  “Developed” means that an item, component, or process exists and is workable.  Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or the process practiced.  Workability is generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended.  Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state of the art.  To be considered “developed,” the item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component, or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(8)  “Developed exclusively at private expense” means development was accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional development costs necessary to complete development shall not be considered when determining whether development was at government, private, or mixed expense.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(9)  “Developed exclusively with government funds” means development was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(10)  “Developed with mixed funding” means development was accomplished partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged directly to a government contract.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(11)  “Form, fit, and function data” means technical data that describes the required overall physical, functional, and performance characteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable items.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(12)  “Government purpose” means any activity in which the United States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements with international or multi-national defense organizations, or sales or transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or international organizations.  Government purposes include competitive procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data for commercial purposes or authorize others to do so.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(13)  “Government purpose rights” means the rights to—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data within the Government without restriction; and</p>

         <p class="p List2">(14)  “Limited rights” means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, in whole or in part, within the Government.  The Government may not, without the written permission of the party asserting limited rights, release or disclose the technical data outside the Government, use the technical data for manufacture, or authorize the technical data to be used by another party, except that the Government may reproduce, release, or disclose such data or authorize the use or reproduction of the data by persons outside the Government if—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  The reproduction, release, disclosure, or use is—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  A release or disclosure to—</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>)  A covered Government support contractor in performance of its covered Government support contract for use, modification, reproduction, performance, display, or release or disclosure to a person authorized to receive limited rights technical data; or</p>

         <p class="p List2">(15)  “Technical data” means recorded information, regardless of the form or method of the recording, of a scientific or technical nature (including computer software documentation).  The term does not include computer software or data incidental to contract administration, such as financial and/or management information.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(16)  “Unlimited rights” means rights to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release, or disclose technical data in whole or in part, in any manner, and for any purpose whatsoever, and to have or authorize others to do so.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(viii)  Data in which the Government has obtained unlimited rights under another Government contract or as a result of negotiations; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ix)  Data furnished to the Government, under this or any other Government contract or subcontract thereunder, with—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Government purpose license rights or limited rights and the restrictive condition(s) has/have expired; or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  Government purpose rights and the Contractor's exclusive right to use such data for commercial purposes has expired.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  <em class="ph i">Government purpose rights</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  The Government shall have government purpose rights for a five-year period, or such other period as may be negotiated, in technical data—</p>

         <p class="p List2">(3)  Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.  However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4)  The Contractor and higher-tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data from their subcontractors or suppliers.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5)  In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.</p>
