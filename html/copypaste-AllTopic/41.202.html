						            Prior to executing a utility service contract, the contracting officer shall comply with <a class="xref fm:Parts" href="Part_6.html#FAR_Part_6">parts&nbsp; 6</a> and <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="Part_7.html#FAR_Part_7">7</a> and subsections <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="41.201.html#FAR_41_201">41.201</a>(d) and (e) of this part. In accordance with <a class="xref fm:Parts" href="Part_6.html#FAR_Part_6">parts&nbsp; 6</a> and <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="Part_7.html#FAR_Part_7">7</a>, agencies shall conduct market surveys and perform acquisition planning in order to promote and provide for full and open competition provided that the contracting officer determines that any resultant contract would not be inconsistent with applicable state law governing the provision of electric utility services. If competition for an entire utility service is not available, the market survey may be used to determine the availability of competitive sources for certain portions of the requirement. The scope of the term "entire utility service" includes the provision of the utility service capacity, energy, water, sewage, transportation, standby or back-up service, transmission and/or distribution service, quality assurance, system reliability, system operation and maintenance, metering, and billing.</p>
