         <p class="p List1">(a) Under Reorganization Plan
No. 14 of 1950, contracting agencies are tasked with the primary
responsibility for the conduct of labor standards compliance activities
for construction contracts subject to the Construction Wage Rate
Requirements statute. When such compliance assurance activities
disclose potential violations that are substantial in amount (wage underpayments
in excess of $1,000) or when requested by the Department of Labor,
the contracting officer or a designee should take the following
steps to ensure compliance with the investigative requirements of
the Department of Labor:</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) <em class="ph i">Beginning of the investigation</em>.
The investigator shall—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Inform the contractor of the investigation
in advance;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Verify the exact legal name of the
contractor, its address, and the names and titles of its principal
officers;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Outline the general scope of the investigation,
including the examination of pertinent records and the interview of
employees;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) Inform the contractor that the names
of the employees to be interviewed will not be divulged to the contractor; and</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) When requested, provide a letter from
the contracting officer verifying the investigator's authority.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Conduct of the investigation</em>.

         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) Verify that all required labor
standards and clauses and wage determinations are included in the
contract.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) Review the following items in
the contract file, if applicable:</p>

and Acknowledgement.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Interview of the complainant. If the
investigation is based upon the receipt of a complaint, the investigator
should interview the complainant unless this is impractical. The
interview shall cover all aspects of the complaint to ensure that
all pertinent information is obtained. Whenever an investigation
does not include an interview of the complainant, explain such omission
in the investigator's report.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Interview of employees and former employees.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) Interview a sufficient number
of employees or former employees, who represent all classifications,
to develop information regarding the method and amount of payments,
deductions, hours worked, and the type of work performed.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) Interview employees at the job
site if the interviews can be conducted privately and in such a
manner so as to cause the least inconvenience to the employer and
employees.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">3</em>) Former employees may be interviewed
elsewhere.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">4</em>) Do not disclose to any employee
any information, finding, recommendation, or conclusion relating

on the case, without the employee's written permission.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">6</em>) Obtain information by mail when
personal interviews are impractical.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">7</em>) Use SF 1445, Labor Standards

         <p class="p List4">(D) Interview of foremen. Interview foremen
to obtain information concerning the contractor's compliance with
the labor standards provisions with respect to employees under the
foreman's supervision and the correctness of the foreman's classification

of employee interviews, and the recording and use of information
obtained, apply to foremen interviews.</p>

         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">i</em>) The interview does not mean
that a violation has been found or that a requirement for corrective
action exists; and</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">ii</em>) The purpose of the interview
is to obtain only such data as the contractor may desire to present
in connection with the investigation.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">3</em>) Do not disclose the identity
of any individual who filed a complaint or was interviewed.</p>

records.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) Review contractor and subcontractor
records such as basic time cards, books, cancelled payroll checks, fringe
benefits, and payment records. Compare them with submitted payrolls.
When discrepancies are found, include pertinent excerpts or copies
of the records in the investigation report with a statement of the

include contributions or anticipated costs for fringe payments requiring
approval of the Secretary of Labor, examine the contractor records
to ensure such approval has been obtained and that any requirements
specified in the approval have been met. (See <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 22.406-2</span>(a)(3).)</p>
