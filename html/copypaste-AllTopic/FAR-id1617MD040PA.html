                  When a service contract succeeds a contract for performance of the same or similar services, as defined at 29 CFR <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1115819.html#i1115819">9.2</a>, at the same location, the successor contractor and its subcontractors are required to offer those service employees that are employed under the predecessor contract, and whose employment will be terminated as a result of the award of the successor contract, a right of first refusal of employment under the contract in positions for which they are qualified. Executive Order 13495 generally prohibits employment openings under the successor contract until such right of first refusal has been provided, when consistent with applicable law.</p>
            
            
               <p class="p" id="id1617MD040PA__d1440e26"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span>
                  Nothing in Executive Order 13495 shall be construed to permit a contractor or subcontractor to fail to comply with any provision of any other Executive order or law. For example, the requirements of the HUBZone Program (see subpart <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1099552.html#i1099552">19.13</a>), Executive Order 11246 (Equal Employment Opportunity), and the Vietnam Era Veteransâ€™ Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 may, in certain circumstances, conflict with the requirements of Executive Order 13495. All applicable laws and Executive orders must be satisfied in tandem with, and if necessary prior to, the requirements of Executive Order 13495 and this subpart.</p>
