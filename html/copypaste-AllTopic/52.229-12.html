of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service Form W-14, Certificate

is applied at the payment level, not at the contract level. The
Contractor should revise each IRS Form W-14 submission to reflect
the exemption (if any) that applies to that particular invoice,
such as a different exemption applying. In the absence of a completed
IRS Form W-14 accompanying a payment request, the default withholding
percentage is 2 percent for the section 5000C withholding for that payment
request. Information about IRS Form W-14 and its separate instructions
is available via the internet at <a class="xref" href="https://www.irs.gov/w14" target="_blank">www.irs.gov/w14</a>.</p>

claims an exemption. If the Contractor enters a ratio in Line 12

2 percent multiplied by the contract ratio. If the Contractor marks
box 9 of the IRS Form W-14 (rather than completes Lines 10 through
12), the Contractor must
identify and enter the specific exempt and nonexempt amounts
in Line 15 of the IRS Form W-14; the Government will then withhold
2 percent only from the nonexempt amount. See the IRS Form W-14

may, for a fee, seek advice from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
as to the proper tax treatment of a transaction. This is called
a private letter ruling. Also, the IRS may publish a revenue ruling,
which is an official interpretation by the IRS of the Internal Revenue
Code, related statutes, tax treaties, and regulations. A revenue
ruling is the conclusion of the IRS on how the law is applied to
a specific set of facts. For questions relating to the interpretation
