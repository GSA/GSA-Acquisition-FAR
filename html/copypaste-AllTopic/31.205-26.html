of such items as raw materials, parts, subassemblies, components,
and manufacturing supplies, whether purchased or manufactured by
the contractor, and may include such collateral items as inbound
transportation and in-transit insurance. In computing material costs,
the contractor shall consider reasonable overruns, spoilage, or
defective work (unless otherwise provided in any contract provision
relating to inspecting and correcting defective work).</p>
