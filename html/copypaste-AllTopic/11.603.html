						            There are two levels of priority for rated orders established by the DPAS, identified by the rating symbols "DO" and "DX". All DO rated orders have equal priority with each other and take preference over unrated orders. All DX rated orders have equal priority with each other and take preference over DO rated and unrated orders (see <span class="ph CFR">15 CFR 700.11</span>). The DPAS regulation contains provisions concerning the elements of a rated order (see <span class="ph CFR">15 CFR 700.12</span>); acceptance and rejection of rated orders (see <span class="ph CFR">15 CFR 700.13</span>); preferential scheduling (see <span class="ph CFR">15 CFR 700.14</span>); extension of priority ratings (flowdown) (see <span class="ph CFR">15 CFR 700.15</span>); changes or cancellations of priority ratings and rated orders (see <span class="ph CFR">15 CFR 700.16</span>); use of rated orders (see <span class="ph CFR">15 CFR 700.17</span>); and limitations on placing rated orders (see <span class="ph CFR">15 CFR 700.18</span>).</p>

						            The Delegate Agencies have been given authority by the Department of Commerce to place rated orders in support of approved programs (see Schedule I of the DPAS). Other U.S. Government agencies, Canada, and foreign nations may apply for priority rating authority.</p>

						            Contracting officers, contractors, or subcontractors at any tier, that experience difficulty placing rated orders, obtaining timely delivery under rated orders, locating a contractor or supplier to fill a rated order, ensuring that rated orders receive preferential treatment by contractors or suppliers, or require rating authority for items not automatically ratable under the DPAS, should promptly seek special priorities assistance in accordance with agency procedures (see <span class="ph CFR">15 CFR 700.50-700.55</span> and 700.80).</p>
