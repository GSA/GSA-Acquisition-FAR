						            A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier’s quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.</p>
            
            
               <p class=" ListL1" id="FAR_13_004__d752e15">
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span>
                  
						            When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing, as defined at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="2.101.html#FAR_2_101">2.101</a>. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.</p>
            
            
               <p class=" ListL1" id="FAR_13_004__d752e23">
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span>
                  
						            If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. (See <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="13.302-4.html#FAR_13_302_4">13.302-4</a> for procedures on termination or cancellation of purchase orders.)</p>
