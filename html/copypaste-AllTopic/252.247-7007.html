         <p class="p List2">(2)  The damage, injury, or death resulted solely from an act or omission of the Government or its employees, or resulted solely from proper compliance by officers, agents, or employees of the Contractor with specific directions of the Contracting Officer.</p>

This requirement is without regard to whether such suit, demand, claim, or action was the result of the Contractor's negligence.  The Government shall have the right to appear in such suit, participate in defense, and take such actions as may be necessary to protect the interest of the United States.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(h)  It is expressly agreed that the provisions in paragraphs (d) through (g) of this clause shall not in any manner limit the liability or extend the liability of the Contractor as provided in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this clause.</p>
