                        Agencies shall establish procedures governing the suspension decision-making process that are as informal as is practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental fairness. These procedures shall afford the contractor (and any specifically named affiliates) an opportunity, following the imposition of suspension, to submit, in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to the suspension. If the suspending and debarring official extends the opportunity for the contractor to submit material in opposition, then the official should also give a deadline for submission of materials. The suspending and debarring official may use the flexible procedures in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="9.406-3.html#FAR_9_406_3">9.406-3</a>(b)(1); if so, the suspending and debarring official should change the notice in paragraph (c)(5) of this section to include those flexible procedures.
