						            After consultation with legal counsel, the contracting officer shall release the security interest on the individual surety’s assets using the <a class="xref" href="https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/release-lien-real-property" target="_blank">Optional&nbsp;Form&nbsp;90</a>, Release of Lien on Real Property, or <a class="xref" href="https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/release-personal-property-escrow" target="_blank">Optional&nbsp;Form&nbsp;91</a>, Release of Personal Property from Escrow, or a similar release as soon as possible consistent with the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this subsection. A surety’s assets pledged in support of a payment bond may be released to a subcontractor or supplier upon Government receipt of a Federal district court judgment, or a sworn statement by the subcontractor or supplier that the claim is correct along with a notarized authorization of the release by the surety stating that it approves of such release.</p>

						            Upon written request by the individual surety, the contracting officer may release a portion of the security interest on the individual surety’s assets based upon substantial performance of the contractor’s obligations under its performance bond. Release of the security interest in support of a payment bond must comply with the paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this subsection. In making this determination, the contracting officer will give consideration as to whether the unreleased portion of the lien is sufficient to cover the remaining contract obligations, including payments to subcontractors and other potential liabilities. The individual surety shall, as a condition of the partial release, furnish an affidavit agreeing that the release of such assets does not relieve the individual surety of its obligations under the bond(s).</p>
