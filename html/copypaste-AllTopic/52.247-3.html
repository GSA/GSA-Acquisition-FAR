						            If the move specified in this contract will not be performed by the Contractor as carrier, it must be performed for the Contractor by a carrier operating under a subcontract with the Contractor. In this case, the Contractor shall not be subject to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this clause, but shall be responsible for requiring and ensuring that the subcontractor carrier complies with those requirements in every respect.</p>

If a Federal office move is intrastate and the contracting officer determines that it is in the Government’s interest not to apply the requirements for holding or obtaining State authority to operate within the State, and to maintain a facility within the State or Commercial zone, delete paragraph (b) of the basic clause and redesignate the remaining paragraphs"(b) and (c)." In the 6 th line of the new paragraph (b), delete the words "paragraphs(a) and (b) above" and replace them with "paragraph (a) of this clause."</p>
