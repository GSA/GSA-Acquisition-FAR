Contracting officers may use any simplified acquisition procedure in this part, subject to any specific dollar limitation applicable to the particular procedure. The purpose of these simplified procedures is to vest contracting officers with additional procedural discretion and flexibility, so that commercial acquisitions in this dollar range may be solicited, offered, evaluated, and awarded in a simplified manner that maximizes efficiency and economy and minimizes burden and administrative costs for both the Government and industry (<a class="xref" href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-section3205&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" target="_blank">10 U.S.C. 3205-3208</a> and chapter 241 and <a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title41-section3305&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" target="_blank">41 U.S.C.3305</a>, 3306, and chapter 37, Awarding of Contracts).</p>
