and clauses established in this subpart are intended to address,
to the maximum extent practicable, commercial market practices for
a wide range of potential Government acquisitions of commercial
products and commercial services. However, because of the broad
range of commercial products
and commercial services acquired by the Government, variations
in commercial practices, and the relative volume of the Government’s
acquisitions in the specific market, contracting officers may, within
the limitations of this subpart, and after conducting appropriate
market research, tailor the provision at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="52.212-1.html#FAR_52_212_1">52.212-1</a>, Instructions

and Conditions-Commercial Products and Commercial Services, to adapt
to the market conditions for each acquisition.</p>

inconsistent with customary commercial practice</em>. The contracting
officer shall not tailor any clause or otherwise include any additional
terms or conditions in a solicitation or contract for commercial
products or commercial services in a manner that is inconsistent
with customary commercial practice for the item being acquired unless
a waiver is approved in accordance with agency procedures. The request
for waiver must describe the customary commercial practice found
in the marketplace, support the need to include a term or condition
that is inconsistent with that practice and include a determination
that use of the customary commercial practice is inconsistent with
the needs of the Government. A waiver may be requested for an individual
or class of contracts for that specific item.</p>

are attached. These addenda may include, for example, a continuation
