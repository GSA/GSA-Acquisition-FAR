                  Separate offers and acceptances are not required for individual orders under multiple-award contracts (including the Federal Supply Schedules managed by GSA, multi-agency contracts or Governmentwide acquisition contracts, or indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts) that have been set aside for exclusive competition among 8(a) contractors, and the individual order is to be competed among all 8(a) contract holders. SBA's acceptance of the original contract is valid for the term of the contract. Offers and acceptances are required for individual orders under multiple-award contracts that have not been set aside for exclusive competition among 8(a) contractors.</p>

However, if an 8(a) contractor rerepresents that it is other than small for the NAICS code(s) assigned under the contract in accordance with <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i19_301-2.html#i19_301-2">19.301-2</a> or, where ownership or control of the 8(a) contractor has changed and SBA has granted a waiver to allow the contractor to continue performance (see <span class="ph CFR">13 CFR 124.515</span>), the agency may not credit any subsequent orders awarded to the contractor towards its small disadvantaged business or small business goals.</p>
