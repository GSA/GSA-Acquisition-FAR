						            Any assignment of claims that has been made under the Act to any type of financing institution listed in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="32.802.html#FAR_32_802">32.802</a>(b) may thereafter be further assigned and reassigned to any such institution if the conditions in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="32.802.html#FAR_32_802">32.802</a>(d) and (e) continue to be met.</p>

						            A contract may prohibit the assignment of claims if the agency determines the prohibition to be in the Governmentâ€™s interest.</p>

						            Under a requirements or indefinite quantity type contract that authorizes ordering and payment by multiple Government activities, amounts due for individual orders for $1,000 or more may be assigned.</p>

                  <span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span>
						            Any contract of a designated agency (see FAR <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="32.801.html#FAR_32_801">32.801</a>), except a contract under which full payment has been made, may include a no-setoff commitment only when a determination of need is made by the head of the agency, in accordance with the Presidential delegation of authority dated October 3,1995, and after such determination has been published in the <em class="ph i">Federal Register.</em> The Presidential delegation makes such determinations of need subject to further guidance issued by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy. The following guidance has been provided:</p>
               <p class="p" id="FAR_32_803__d2170e41"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Use of the no-setoff provision may be appropriate to facilitate the national defense; in the event of a national emergency or natural disaster; or when the use of the no-setoff provision may facilitate private financing of contract performance. However, in the event an offeror is significantly indebted to the United States, the contracting officer should consider whether the inclusion of the no-setoff commitment in a particular contract is in the best interests of the United States. In such an event, the contracting officer should consult with the Government officer(s) responsible for collecting the debt(s).</p>
            
            
               <p class="p" id="FAR_32_803__d2170e44"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span>
						            When an assigned contract does not include a no-setoff commitment, the Government may apply against payments to the assignee any liability of the contractor to the Government arising independently of the assigned contract if the liability existed at the time notice of the assignment was received even though that liability had not yet matured so as to be due and payable.</p>
