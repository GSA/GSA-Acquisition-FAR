The term does not include the normal administrative costs of processing the VECP or any increase in instant contract cost or price resulting from negative instant contract savings, except that for use in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="52.248-3.html#FAR_52_248_3">52.248-3</a>, see the definition at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="52.248-3.html#FAR_52_248_3">52.248-3</a>(b).</p>

It does not include increases in quantities after acceptance of the VECP that are due to contract modifications, exercise of options, or additional orders. If the contract is a multiyear contract, the term does not include quantities funded after VECP acceptance. In a fixed-price contract with prospective price redetermination, the term refers to the period for which firm prices have been established.</p>

In service contracts, the instant unit cost reduction is normally equal to the number of hours per line-item task saved by using the VECP on the instant contract, multiplied by the appropriate contract labor rate.</p>
