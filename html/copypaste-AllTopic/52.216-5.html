								                The statement	required by paragraph (h)(1) of this section need not be submitted	for any quarter for which either no costs are to be reported under	subdivision (h)(1)(ii) of this section, or revised billing prices	have been established in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section,	and do not exceed the existing contract price, the Contractor’s	price-redetermination proposal, or a price based on the most recent	quarterly statement, whichever is least.</p>

								                Notwithstanding	any provision of this contract authorizing greater payments, if	on any quarterly statement the amount under subdivision (h)(1)(iv)	of this section exceeds the sum due the Contractor, as computed	in accordance with subdivisions (h)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this	section, the Contractor shall immediately refund or credit to the	Government the amount of this excess. The Contractor may, when appropriate,	reduce this refund or credit by the amount of any applicable tax	credits due the Contractor under <a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml;jsessionid=114A3287C7B3359E597506A31FC855B3" target="_blank">26 U.S.C.1481</a> and	by the amount of previous refunds or credits affected under this	clause. If any portion of the excess has been applied to the liquidation	of progress payments, then that portion may, instead of being refunded,	be added to the unliquidated progress payment account, consistent	with the Progress Payments clause. The Contractor shall provide	complete details to support any claimed reductions in refunds.</p>

								                If the	Contractor fails to submit the quarterly statement within 45 days	after the end of each quarter and it is later determined that the	Government has overpaid the Contractor, the Contractor shall repay	the excess to the Government immediately. Unless repaid within 30	days after the end of the statement submittal period, the amount	of the excess shall bear interest, computed from the date the quarterly	statement was due to the date of repayment, at the rate established in	accordance with the Interest clause.</p>

For the purpose	of paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of this section, and pending final	settlement of the disagreement on appeal, by failure to appeal,	or by agreement, this decision shall be treated as an executed contract modification.	Pending final settlement, price redetermination for subsequent periods,	if any, shall continue to be negotiated as provided in this clause.</p>
