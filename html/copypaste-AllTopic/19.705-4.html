						            If, under a sealed bid solicitation, a bidder submits a plan that does not cover each of the 15 required elements (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="19.704.html#FAR_19_704">19.704</a>), the contracting officer shall advise the bidder of the deficiency and request submission of a revised plan by a specific date. If the bidder does not submit a plan that incorporates the required elements within the time allotted, the bidder shall be ineligible for award. If the plan, although responsive, evidences the bidder’s intention not to comply with its obligations under the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="52.219-8.html#FAR_52_219_8">52.219-8</a>, Utilization of Small Business Concerns, the contracting officer may find the bidder nonresponsible.</p>

						            In negotiated acquisitions, the contracting officer shall determine whether the plan is acceptable based on the negotiation of each of the 15 elements of the plan (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="19.704.html#FAR_19_704">19.704</a>). Subcontracting goals should be set at a level that the parties reasonably expect can result from the offeror expending good faith efforts to use small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business subcontractors to the maximum practicable extent. The contracting officer shall take particular care to ensure that the offeror has not submitted unreasonably low goals to minimize exposure to liquidated damages and to avoid the administrative burden of substantiating good faith efforts. Additionally, particular attention should be paid to the identification of steps that, if taken, would be considered a good faith effort. No goal should be negotiated upward if it is apparent that a higher goal will significantly increase the Government’s cost or seriously impede the attainment of acquisition objectives. An incentive subcontracting clause (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="52.219-10.html#FAR_52_219_10">52.219-10</a>, Incentive Subcontracting Program), may be used when additional and unique contract effort, such as providing technical assistance, could significantly increase subcontract awards to small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, or women-owned small business concerns.</p>

If information is not available on a specific type of product or service, evaluate the offeror’s overall past performance and consider the performance of other contractors on similar efforts.</p>

								                Evaluate the offeror’s make-or-buy policy or program to ensure that it does not conflict with the offeror’s proposed subcontracting plan and is in the Government’s interest. If the contract involves products or services that are particularly specialized or not generally available in the commercial market, consider the offeror’s current capacity to perform the work and the possibility of reduced subcontracting opportunities.</p>

								                Evaluate subcontracting potential, considering the offeror’s make-or-buy policies or programs, the nature of the supplies or services to be subcontracted, the known availability of small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns in the geographical area where the work will be performed, and the potential contractor’s long-standing contractual relationship with its suppliers.</p>
                  
                  
                     <p class="p" id="FAR_19_705_4__d1219e111"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                        <span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span>
								                Advise the offeror of available sources of information on potential small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business subcontractors, as well as any specific concerns known to be potential subcontractors. If the offeror’s proposed goals are questionable, the contracting officer must emphasize that the information should be used to develop realistic and acceptable goals.</p>
