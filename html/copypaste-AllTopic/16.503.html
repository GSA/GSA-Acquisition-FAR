contract provides for filling all actual purchase requirements of
designated Government activities for supplies or services during
a specified contract period (from one contractor), with deliveries
or performance to be scheduled by placing orders with the contractor.</p>

the information of offerors and contractors, the contracting officer
shall state a realistic estimated total quantity in the solicitation
and resulting contract. This estimate is not a representation to
an offeror or contractor that the estimated quantity will be required
or ordered, or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable
or normal. The contracting officer may obtain the estimate from
records of previous requirements and consumption, or by other means, and
should base the estimate on the most current information available.</p>

shall state, if feasible, the maximum limit of the contractor’s
obligation to deliver and the Government’s obligation to order.
The contract may also specify maximum or minimum quantities that
the Government may order under each individual order and the maximum
that it may order during a specified period of time.</p>
