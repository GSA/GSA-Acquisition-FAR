a warranty for the entire item is not advisable, a warranty may
be required for a particular aspect of the item that may require
special protection (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> installation, components, accessories,
subassemblies, preservation, packaging, and packing, etc.).</p>

Government specifies the design of the end item and its measurements,
tolerances, materials, tests, or inspection requirements, the contractor’s
obligations for correction of defects shall usually be limited to
defects in material and workmanship or failure to conform to specifications.
If the Government does not specify the design, the warranty extends
also to the usefulness of the design.</p>
