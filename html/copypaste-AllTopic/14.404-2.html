						            A bid shall be rejected when the bidder imposes conditions that would modify requirements of the invitation or limit the bidder’s liability to the Government, since to allow the bidder to impose such conditions would be prejudicial to other bidders.

						            A low bidder may be requested to delete objectionable conditions from a bid provided the conditions do not go to the substance, as distinguished from the form, of the bid, or work an injustice on other bidders. A condition goes to the substance of a bid where it affects price, quantity, quality, or delivery of the items offered.</p>

						            After submitting a bid, if all of a bidder’s assets or that part related to the bid are transferred during the period between the bid opening and the award, the transferee may not be able to take over the bid. Accordingly, the contracting officer shall reject the bid unless the transfer is effected by merger, operation of law, or other means not barred by <a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title41-section6305&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" target="_blank">41 U.S.C.6305</a> or <a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title31-section3727&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" target="_blank">31 U.S.C. 3727</a>.</p>
