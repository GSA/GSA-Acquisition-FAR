if the contracting officer has reason to believe exceptional circumstances
exist and has sufficient data available to determine a fair and
reasonable price, then the contracting officer should consider requesting
a waiver under the exception at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1105936.html#i1105936">15.403-1</a>(b)(4). <span class="ph FAC 2020-07 August 3, 2020">The threshold for obtaining
