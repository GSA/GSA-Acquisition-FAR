The measure of normal cost under this method for each cost accounting period is the present value of the units of benefit deemed to be credited to employees for service in that period. The measure of the actuarial accrued liability at a plan’s inception date is the present value of the units of benefit credited to employees for service prior to that date. (This method is also known as the unit credit cost method without salary projection.).</p>

The excess of the actuarial accrued liability over the actuarial value of the assets of a pension plan is the unfunded actuarial liability.
