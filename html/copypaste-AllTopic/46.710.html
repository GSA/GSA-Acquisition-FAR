         <p class="p" id="FAR_46_710__d2729e8">The clauses and alternates prescribed
in this section may be used in solicitations and contracts in which
inclusion of a warranty is appropriate (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="46.709.html#FAR_46_709">46.709</a> for warranties
for commercial products
and commercial services). However, because of the many situations
that may influence the warranty terms and conditions appropriate
to a particular acquisition, the contracting officer may vary the
terms and conditions of the clauses and alternates to the extent
necessary. The alternates prescribed in this section address the
clauses; however, the conditions pertaining to each alternate must
be considered if the terms and conditions are varied to meet a particular
need.</p>
