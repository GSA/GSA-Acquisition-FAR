         <p class="p" id="FAR_46_710__d2733e8">The clauses and alternates prescribed in this section may be used in solicitations and contracts in which inclusion of a warranty is appropriate (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="46.709.html#FAR_46_709">46.709</a> for warranties for commercial items). However, because of the many situations that may influence the warranty terms and conditions appropriate to a particular acquisition, the contracting officer may vary the terms and conditions of the clauses and alternates to the extent necessary. The alternates prescribed in this section address the clauses; however, the conditions pertaining to each alternate must be considered if the terms and conditions are varied to meet a particular need.</p>
