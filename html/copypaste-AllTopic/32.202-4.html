The contracting officer shall specify in the solicitation the type of security the Government will accept. If the Government is willing to accept more than one form of security, the offeror shall be required to specify the form of security it will provide.

of Purchases of Commercial

financial condition shall consider both net worth and liquidity.
If the contracting officer finds the offeror’s financial condition
is not adequate security, the contracting officer shall require
other adequate security. Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this subsection
