                  Offers shall be solicited from those sources identified in accordance with <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1099930.html#i1099930">19.804-3</a>.</p>

                  The SBA will determine the eligibility of the participants for award of the contract. Eligibility will be determined by the SBA as of the time of submission of initial offers which include price. Eligibility is based on Section 8(a) program criteria. An 8(a) participant must represent that it is a small business in accordance with the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract.</p>

                        In either negotiated or sealed bid competitive 8(a) acquisitions SBA will determine the eligibility of the apparent successful offeror and advise the contracting office within 5 working days after receipt of the contracting office's request for an eligibility determination.</p>

                              If SBA determines that the apparent successful offeror is ineligible, the contracting office will then send to SBA the identity of the next highest evaluated offeror for an eligibility determination. The process is repeated until SBA determines that an identified offeror is eligible for award.</p>

                              If the contracting officer believes that the apparent successful offeror (or the offeror SBA has determined eligible for award) is not responsible to perform the contract, the contracting officer must refer the matter to SBA for Certificate of Competency consideration under subpart <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1100603.html#i1100603">19.6</a>.</p>

                        In any case in which an 8(a) participant is determined to be ineligible, SBA will notify the 8(a) participant of that determination.</p>

                  Any party with information questioning the eligibility of an 8(a) participant to continue participation in the 8(a) program or for the purposes of a specific 8(a) award may submit such information to the SBA in accordance with <span class="ph CFR">13 CFR 124.112(c)</span>.</p>
