                              In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 1907, this domestic content test of the
                              Buy American statute has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items

                              For an end product that
consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination
of both, the cost of foreign iron and steel must constitute less
than 5 percent of the cost of all the components used in the end
product (see the definition of "foreign iron and steel" at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="25.003.html#FAR_25_003">25.003</a>).
The cost of foreign iron and steel includes but is not limited to
the cost of foreign iron or steel mill products (such as bar, billet,
slab, wire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings utilized in
the manufacture of the end product and a good faith estimate of
the cost of all foreign iron or steel components excluding COTS
fasteners. This domestic content test of the Buy American statute
has not been waived for acquisitions of COTS items in this category,
except for COTS fasteners.

                   The Buy
American statute applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured
product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product,
but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the domestic content test in
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>

                   Exceptions
that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="25.103.html#FAR_25_103">25.103</a>. The unreasonable
cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor
applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The
evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign
offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided
