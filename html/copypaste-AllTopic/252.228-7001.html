         <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Conditions for Government’s self-insurance</em>. The Government's assumption of risk for aircraft in the open shall continue unless the Contracting Officer finds that the Contractor has failed to comply with paragraph (b) of this clause, or that the aircraft is in the open under unreasonable conditions, and the Contractor fails to take prompt corrective action.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The Contracting Officer, when finding that the Contractor has failed to comply with paragraph (b) of this clause or that the aircraft is in the open under unreasonable conditions, shall notify the Contractor in writing and shall require the Contractor to make corrections within a reasonable time.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Upon receipt of the notice, the Contractor shall promptly correct the cited conditions, regardless of whether there is agreement that the conditions are unreasonable.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(ii) Any dispute as to the timeliness of the Contractor's action or the equitable adjustment shall be considered a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(ii) Any costs incurred by the Contractor (including the costs of the Contractor’s self-insurance, insurance premiums paid to insure the Contractor’s assumption of risk, deductibles associated with such purchased insurance, etc.) to mitigate its assumption of risk are unallowable costs; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) The liability provisions of the Government Property clause of this contract are not applicable to the affected aircraft.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer when unreasonable conditions have been corrected.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(ii) If the Government does not again assume the risk of loss and the unreasonable conditions have been corrected, the Contractor shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment for insurance costs, if any, extending after the third working day after the Government’s receipt of the Contractor’s notice of correction.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) The Government’s termination of its assumption of risk of loss does not relieve the Contractor of its obligation to comply with all other provisions of this clause, including the combined regulation/instruction entitled “Contractor’s Flight and Ground Operations.”</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Exclusions from the Government’s assumption of risk</em>. The Government's assumption of risk shall not extend to damage, loss, or destruction of aircraft which—</p>

(This exclusion does not apply to Government-furnished property if damage consists of reasonable wear and tear or deterioration, or results from inherent vice, e.g., a known condition or design defect, in the property); or</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) Is sustained while the aircraft is being worked on and is a direct result of the work unless such damage, loss, or destruction would be covered by insurance which would have been maintained by the Contractor, but for the Government's assumption of risk.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) <em class="ph i">Contractor’s share of loss and Contractor’s deductible under the</em> Government’s self-insurance.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The Contractor assumes the risk of loss and shall be responsible for the Contractor’s share of loss under the Government’s self-insurance. That share is the lesser of—</p>

         <p class="p List1">(h) <em class="ph i">Contractor’s exclusion of insurance costs.</em> The Contractor warrants that the contract price does not and will not include, except as may be authorized in this clause, any charge or contingency reserve for insurance covering damage, loss, or destruction of aircraft while in the open, during operation, or in flight when the risk has been assumed by the Government including the Contractor’s share of loss in this clause, even if the assumption may be terminated for aircraft in the open.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) <em class="ph i">Procedures in the event of loss</em>. (1) In the event of damage, loss, or destruction of aircraft in the open, during operation, or in flight, the Contractor shall take all reasonable steps to protect the aircraft from further damage, to separate damaged and undamaged aircraft and to put all aircraft in the best possible order. Except in cases covered by paragraph (f)(2) of this clause, the Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Officer a statement of—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The damaged, lost, or destroyed aircraft;</p>

         <p class="p List3">(iv) The insurance, if any, covering the interest in commingled property.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The Contracting Officer will make an equitable adjustment for expenditures made by the Contractor in performing the obligations under this paragraph.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(j) <em class="ph i">Loss prior to delivery.</em>(1)<em class="ph i"></em> If prior to delivery and acceptance by the Government, aircraft is damaged, lost, or destroyed and the Government assumed the risk, the Government shall either—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Require that the aircraft be replaced or restored by the Contractor to the condition immediately prior to the damage, in which event the Contracting Officer will make an equitable adjustment in the contract price and the time for contract performance; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Terminate this contract with respect to the aircraft. Notwithstanding the provisions in any other termination clause under this contract, in the event of termination, the Contractor shall be paid the contract price for the aircraft (or, if applicable, any work to be performed on the aircraft) less any amount the Contracting Officer determines—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) It would have cost the Contractor to complete the aircraft (or any work to be performed on the aircraft) together with anticipated profit on uncompleted work; and</p>

         <p class="p List2">(2) The Contracting Officer shall prescribe the manner of disposition of the damaged, lost, or destroyed aircraft, or any parts of the aircraft. If any additional costs of such disposition are incurred by the Contractor, a further equitable adjustment will be made in the amount due the Contractor. Failure of the parties to agree upon termination costs or an equitable adjustment with respect to any aircraft shall be considered a dispute under the Disputes clause.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(k) <em class="ph i">Reimbursement from a third party.</em> In the event the Contractor is reimbursed or compensated by a third party for damage, loss, or destruction of aircraft and has also been compensated by the Government, the Contractor shall equitably reimburse the Government. The Contractor shall do nothing to prejudice the Government's right to recover against third parties for damage, loss, or destruction. Upon the request of the Contracting Officer or authorized representative, the Contractor shall at Government expense furnish to the Government all reasonable assistance and cooperation (including the prosecution of suit and the execution of instruments of assignment or subrogation) in obtaining recovery.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(l) <em class="ph i">Government acceptance of liability</em>. To the extent the Government has accepted such liability under other provisions of this contract, the Contractor shall not be reimbursed for liability to third persons for loss or damage to property or for death or bodily injury caused by aircraft during flight unless the flight crew members previously have been approved for this flight in writing by the Government Flight Representative, who has been authorized in accordance with the combined regulation entitled “Contractor’s Flight and Ground Operations”.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(m) <em class="ph i">Subcontracts</em>. The Contractor shall incorporate the requirements of this clause, including this paragraph (m), in all subcontracts.</p>
