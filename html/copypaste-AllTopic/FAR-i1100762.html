                   Before setting aside an acquisition
under this paragraph, refer to <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1101696.html#i1101696">19.203</a>(b). Each acquisition of supplies
or services that has an anticipated dollar value above the micro-purchase
threshold, but not over the simplified acquisition threshold, shall be
set aside for small business unless the contracting officer determines
there is not a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two
or more responsible small business concerns that are competitive
in terms of fair market prices, quality, and delivery. If the
contracting officer receives only one acceptable offer from a responsible
small business concern in response to a set-aside, the contracting
officer should make an award to that firm. If the contracting officer
receives no acceptable offers from responsible small business concerns,
the set-aside shall be withdrawn and the requirement, if still valid,
shall be resolicited on an unrestricted basis. The small business
set-aside does not preclude the award of a contract as described
in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1101696.html#i1101696">19.203</a>.</p>

                         Offers will

                         Award will
be made at fair market prices. Total small business set-asides shall
not be made unless such a reasonable expectation exists (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1100796.html#i1100796">19.502-3</a> for partial set-asides).
Although past acquisition history and market research of an item or
similar items are always important, these are not the only factors
to be considered in determining whether a reasonable expectation
exists. In making research and development small business set-asides,
there must also be a reasonable expectation of obtaining from small
businesses the best scientific and technological sources consistent
with the demands of the proposed acquisition for the best mix of
cost, performances, and schedules.</p>
