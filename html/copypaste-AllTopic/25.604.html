the cost of domestic unmanufactured construction material. If the
cost of the domestic unmanufactured construction material exceeds
the cost of the foreign unmanufactured construction material by
more than 20
percent, then the contracting officer shall determine that
the cost of the domestic unmanufactured construction material is
unreasonable.</p>
