material (<em class="ph i">i.e.</em>, any construction material not manufactured
in the United States, or construction material consisting predominantly
of iron or steel and the iron or steel is not produced in the United
States) to the estimated price if all domestic manufactured construction

percent, then the contracting officer shall determine that
the cost of the domestic unmanufactured construction material is
unreasonable.</p>
