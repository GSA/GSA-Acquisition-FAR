         <p class="p List1">(c)  DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation, Part IV, Appendix G-3 (available at http://www.transcom.mil/dtr/part-iv/dtr-part-4-app-g3.pdf), contains guidance on schedules as follows:</p>
         <p class="p">Schedule I Outbound Services, Pages 6-12.</p>
         <p class="p">Schedule II Inbound Services, Pages 13-17.</p>
         <p class="p">Schedule III Intra-City and Intra-Area Moves, Page 18.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  <em class="ph i">Demurrage and detention charges</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  Carrier demurrage/detention is a charge made against a consignor (shipper) or consignee (receiver) for the extended use of carrier-furnished equipment when delays attributable to the consignor or consignee occur.  Carrier demurrage/detention rules usually allow a period of free time for loading, unloading, or holding equipment.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Carrier-published demurrage/detention rules and charges are not uniform from one carrier to another.  Contracting officers should specifically address them in the contract.  While demurrage/detention rules are published in individual carrier tariffs or agency tenders, Contracting Officers may negotiate contract-specific demurrage/detention rules and charges independent of any existing tariffs or tenders.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6)  Process any modification of schedule format, other than those authorized in paragraph (c) of this subsection, as a request for deviation to the Commander, SDDC.</p>
