         <p class="p List1">(a)  “Special construction” normally involves a common carrier giving a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements.  This may include—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  Moving or relocating equipment;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Providing temporary facilities;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  Expediting provision of facilities; or</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4)  Providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b)  Use this subpart instead of <span class="ph FARxref">FAR Part 36</span> for acquisition of “special construction.”</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c)  Special construction costs may be—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  A contingent liability for using telecommunications services for a shorter time than the minimum to reimburse the contractor for unamortized nonrecoverable costs.  These costs are usually expressed in terms of a termination liability, as provided in the contract or by tariff;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  A onetime special construction charge;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  Recurring charges for constructed facilities;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4)  A minimum service charge;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5)  An expediting charge; or</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6)  A move or relocation charge.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d)  When a common carrier submits a proposal or quotation which has special construction requirements, the contracting officer shall require a detailed special construction proposal.  Analyze all special construction proposals to—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  Determine the adequacy of the proposed construction;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Disclose excessive or duplicative construction; and</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  When different forms of charge are possible, provide for the form of charge most advantageous to the Government.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e)  When possible, analyze and approve special construction charges before receiving the service.  Impose a ceiling on the special construction costs before authorizing the contractor to proceed, if prior approval is not possible.  The contracting officer must approve special construction charges before final payment.</p>
