            Any
            contractor receiving a contract with a value greater than the
            simplified acquisition threshold must agree in the contract that
            small business, veteran-owned small business (VOSB),
            service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), HUBZone
            small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), and women-owned
            small business (WOSB) concerns will have the maximum practicable
            opportunity to participate in contract performance consistent with
            its efficient performance. It is further the policy of the United
            States that its prime contractors establish procedures to ensure the
            timely payment of amounts due pursuant to the terms of their
            subcontracts with small business, VOSB concerns, SDVOSB concerns,
            HUBZone small business concerns, SDB concerns, and WOSB
            concerns.
