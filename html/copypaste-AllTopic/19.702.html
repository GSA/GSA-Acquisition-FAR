         <p class="p">Any contractor receiving a contract with a value greater
than the simplified acquisition threshold must agree in the contract that
small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned
small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business,
and women-owned small business concerns will have the maximum practicable
opportunity to participate in contract performance consistent with
its efficient performance. It is further the policy of the United
States that its prime contractors establish procedures to ensure
the timely payment of amounts due pursuant to the terms of their
subcontracts with small business, veteran-owned small business,
service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small
disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns.</p>

solicitation of offers to perform a contract that is expected to
exceed $750,000 ($1.5 million for construction) and that has subcontracting
possibilities, shall require the apparently successful offeror to
submit an acceptable subcontracting plan. If the apparently successful
offeror fails to negotiate a subcontracting plan acceptable to the
contracting officer within the time limit prescribed by the contracting
officer, the offeror will be ineligible for award. For a multiple-award

bidding acquisitions, each invitation for bids to perform a contract
that is expected to exceed $750,000 ($1.5 million for construction)

selected for award to submit a subcontracting plan. If the selected
bidder fails to submit a plan within the time limit prescribed by
the contracting officer, the bidder will be ineligible for award.
For a multiple-award contract with more than one NAICS code, see
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.</p>

contract modification that causes the value of a contract without
a subcontracting plan to exceed $750,000 ($1.5 million for construction),

the contract, if the contracting officer determines that subcontracting
opportunities exist. For a multiple-award contract with more than

certain costs incurred by a mentor firm in providing developmental
assistance to a protégé firm under the Department of Defense Pilot
Mentor-Protégé Program, may be credited as if they were subcontract
awards to a protégé firm for the purpose of determining whether
the mentor firm attains the applicable goals under any subcontracting
plan entered into with any executive agency. However, the mentor-protégé
agreement must have been approved by the Director, Small Business
Programs of the cognizant DoD military department or defense agency,
before developmental assistance costs may be credited against subcontract
goals. A list of approved agreements may be obtained at <span class="ph FAC 2021-06 July 12, 2021">
