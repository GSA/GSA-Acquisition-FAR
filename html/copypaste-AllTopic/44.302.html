for a CPSR based on, but not limited to, the past performance of
the contractor, and the volume, complexity and dollar value of subcontracts.
If a contractor’s sales to the Government (excluding competitively
awarded firm-fixed-price and competitively awarded fixed-price with
economic price adjustment contracts and sales of commercial supplies and
commercial services pursuant to 
                     <a class="xref fm:Part" href="Part_12.html#FAR_Part_12">part&nbsp; 12</a>) are expected
to exceed $25 million during the next 12 months, perform a review
to determine if a CPSR is needed. Sales include those represented
by prime contracts, subcontracts under Government prime contracts,
and modifications. Generally, a CPSR is not performed for a specific
contract. The head of the agency responsible for contract administration
may raise or lower the $25 million review level if it is considered
to be in the Government’s best interest.</p>

a purchasing system review is necessary. If necessary, the cognizant
contract administration office will conduct a purchasing system
review.</p>
