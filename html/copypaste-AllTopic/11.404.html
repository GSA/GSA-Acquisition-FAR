								                The contracting officer may use a time of delivery clause to set forth a required delivery schedule and to allow an offeror to propose an alternative delivery schedule.

								                The contracting officer may insert in solicitations and contracts other than those for construction and architect-engineering, a clause substantially the same as the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="52.211-8.html#FAR_52_211_8">52.211-8</a>, Time of Delivery, if the Government requires delivery by a particular time and the delivery schedule is to be based on the date of the contract.

If the delivery schedule is expressed in terms of specific calendar dates or specific periods and is based on an assumed date the contractor will receive notice of award, the contracting officer may use the clause with its Alternate II. If the delivery schedule is to be based on the actual date the contractor receives a written notice of award, the contracting officer may use the clause with its Alternate III.</p>
