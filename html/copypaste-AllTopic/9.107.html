						            The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (Committee), as authorized by 41&nbsp;U.S.C.&nbsp;chapter&nbsp;85, determines what supplies and services Federal agencies are required to purchase from AbilityOne participating nonprofit agencies serving people who are blind or have other severe disabilities (see <a class="xref fm:Subpart" href="Subpart_8.7.html#FAR_Subpart_8_7">subpart&nbsp; 8.7</a>). The Committee is required to find an AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency capable of furnishing the supplies or services before the nonprofit agency can be designated as a mandatory source under the AbilityOne Program. The Committee may request a contracting office to assist in assessing the capabilities of a nonprofit agency.</p>

						            The contracting office, upon request from the Committee, shall request a capability survey from the activity responsible for performing preaward surveys, or notify the Committee that the AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency is capable, with supporting rationale, and that the survey is waived. The capability survey will focus on the technical and production capabilities and applicable preaward survey elements to furnish specific supplies or services being considered for addition to the Procurement List.</p>
