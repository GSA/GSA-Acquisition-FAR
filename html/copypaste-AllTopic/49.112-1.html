                  <em class="ph i">General.</em> If the contract authorizes partial payments on settlement proposals before settlement, a prime contractor may request them on the form prescribed in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="49.602-4.html#FAR_49_602_4">49.602-4</a> at any time after submission of interim or final settlement proposals. The Government will process applications for partial payments promptly. A subcontractor shall submit its application through the prime contractor which shall attach its own invoice and recommendations to the subcontractor’s application. Partial payments to a subcontractor shall be made only through the prime contractor and only after the prime contractor has submitted its interim or final settlement proposal. Except for undelivered acceptable finished products, partial payments shall not be made for profit or fee claimed under the terminated portion of the contract. In exercising discretion on the extent of partial payments to be made, the TCO shall consider the diligence of the contractor in settling with subcontractors and in preparing its own settlement proposal.</p>
