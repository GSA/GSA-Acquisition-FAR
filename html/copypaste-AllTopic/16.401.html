						            Incentive contracts as described in this subpart are appropriate when a firm-fixed-price contract is not appropriate and the required supplies or services can be acquired at lower costs and, in certain instances, with improved delivery or technical performance, by relating the amount of profit or fee payable under the contract to the contractor’s performance.

						            The two basic categories of incentive contracts are fixed-price incentive contracts (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="16.403.html#FAR_16_403">16.403</a> and <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="16.404.html#FAR_16_404">16.404</a>) and cost-reimbursement incentive contracts (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="16.405.html#FAR_16_405">16.405</a>). Since it is usually to the Government’s advantage for the contractor to assume substantial cost responsibility and an appropriate share of the cost risk, fixed-price incentive contracts are preferred when contract costs and performance requirements are reasonably certain. Cost-reimbursement incentive contracts are subject to the overall limitations in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="16.301.html#FAR_16_301">16.301</a> that apply to all cost-reimbursement contracts.</p>
