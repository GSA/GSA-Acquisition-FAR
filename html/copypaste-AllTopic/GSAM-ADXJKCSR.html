incur more expense selling to the Government than to the customer
who receives the offeror’s best price, or the customer (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>,
dealer, distributor, original equipment manufacturer, other reseller)
who receives the best price may perform certain value-added functions
for the offeror that the Government does not perform. In such cases,
some reduction in the discount given to the Government may be appropriate.
If the best price is not offered to the Government, you should ask
the offeror to identify and explain the reason for any differences.
