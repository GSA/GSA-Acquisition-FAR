agreement to which the United States is a party, or is not adhering
to its arms control, nonproliferation, or disarmament commitments

narrative for any such findings reflecting a determination of violation
or non-adherence related to those foreign countries in the report,

giving rise to the compliance or adherence concerns, the analysis
of compliance or adherence concerns, and efforts to resolve compliance
