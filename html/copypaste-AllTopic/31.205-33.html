Examples include those services acquired by contractors or subcontractors in order to enhance their legal, economic, financial, or technical positions. Professional and consultant services are generally acquired to obtain information, advice, opinions, alternatives, conclusions, recommendations, training, or direct assistance, such as studies, analyses, evaluations, liaison with Government officials, or other forms of representation.</p>

						            Costs of professional and consultant services are allowable subject to this paragraph and paragraphs (c) through (f) of this subsection when reasonable in relation to the services rendered and when not contingent upon recovery of the costs from the Government (but see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="31.205-30.html#FAR_31_205_30">31.205-30</a> and <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="31.205-47.html#FAR_31_205_47">31.205-47</a>).</p>

						            In determining the allowability of costs (including retainer fees) in a particular case, no single factor or any special combination of factors is necessarily determinative.

								                Whether the proportion of Government work to the contractor’s total business is such as to influence the contractor in favor of incurring the cost, particularly when the services rendered are not of a continuing nature and have little relationship to work under Government contracts.</p>
