            <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Inspection/Acceptance.</em> (1)
The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished
and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable
at all places and times, including the period of performance, and
in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect
the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in
contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and
tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.</p>
            <p class="p List2">(2) If the Government performs inspection
or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the
Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish
all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient
performance of these duties.</p>
            <p class="p List2">(3) Unless
otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept
or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly
as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted
60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.</p>
            <p class="p List2">(4) At any time during contract performance,
but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified
in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last
delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor
to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery
failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified
in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction
shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the
"hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall
be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit.
Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the "hourly rate"
attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall
not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be
replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement
for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose
the corrective action taken. [<em class="ph i">Insert portion of labor rate attributable

            <p class="p List2">(5)(i) If the Contractor
fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required
replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction
can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price
as increased by the Government), the Government may-</p>
            <p class="p List4">(A) By contract or otherwise, perform
the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased
cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due
under this contract; or</p>
            <p class="p List4">(B) Terminate
this contract for cause.</p>
            <p class="p List3">(ii) Failure
to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor
shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract.</p>
            <p class="p List2">(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4)
and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor
to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government,
any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of
this contract, if the failure is due to-</p>
            <p class="p List3">(i)
Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of
the Contractor's managerial personnel; or</p>
            <p class="p List3">(ii)
The conduct of one or more of the Contractor’s employees selected
or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor’s managerial
personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is
habitually careless or unqualified.</p>
            <p class="p List2">(7)
This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to
corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and
services originally delivered under this contract.</p>
            <p class="p List2">(8) The Contractor has no obligation or
liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and
services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements,
except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified
in the contract.</p>
            <p class="p List2">(9) Unless otherwise
specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct

the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number
of direct labor hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall
be payable on a prorated basis.</p>
            <p class="p List4">(B)
The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract
that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor
hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were
specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work
is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications
specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the
Contracting Officer.</p>
            <p class="p List4">(C) Invoices may
be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if
approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer
or the authorized representative.</p>
            <p class="p List4">(D)
When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative,
the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor
hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence
of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that
verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories
specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in
the contract.</p>
            <p class="p List4">(E) Unless the Schedule
prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not
be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an
overtime basis.</p>

rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves
overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated.</p>

overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes

Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of

cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received
by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided
the Contractor-</p>

accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days,
if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will
exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor
shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of
the total price to the Government for performing this contract with
supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the
performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe
that the total price to the Government for performing this contract
will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling
price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving
a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract,
with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during
performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe
that the work to be required in performing this contract will be
substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the
Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then
revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under

The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount
in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor

exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until
the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that
the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice
a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance
under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price
set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended
and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling
price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent
as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after
the increase in the ceiling price.</p>

be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services
not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government
for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined
that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default,
such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.</p>
