the United States, the contracting officer shall—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Ensure that the solicitation and contract
include any applicable host country and designated operational area
performance considerations. Failure to provide such information—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) May result in a contract that does
not reflect the respective support relationships between the contractor
and the Government, ultimately affecting the ability of the contractor
to fulfill the contract terms and conditions;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) May result in unplanned support burdens
being placed on the Government in a theater of operations;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) May result in contractor personnel
conflicting with theater operations or performing in violation of
a theater commander’s directives or host country laws; or</p>

TBC with the Joint Contingency Contracting System Platform (which
must be consistent with the combat support agency’s established
functions and responsibilities) and set forth by the geographic
combatant commander during declared contingency operations for all
solicitations and contracts that relate to the delivery of supplies
and services to the designated area(s) of operation.</p>

personnel, is visible to the combatant commander;</p>

with in-country commanders’ plans;</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">3</em>) Solicitations and contracts

to exercise control over the assignment of contract administration (which
must be consistent with the combat support agency’s established

of operation.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) Allows the combatant commander
to exercise oversight to ensure the contractor’s compliance with
combatant commander and subordinate task force commander policies,
directives, and terms and conditions;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Refer to the website at http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pacc/cc/index.html,
