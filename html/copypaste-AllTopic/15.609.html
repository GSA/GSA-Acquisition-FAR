						            An unsolicited proposal may include data that the offeror does not want disclosed to the public for any purpose or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes. If the offeror wishes to restrict the data, the title page must be marked with the following legend:</p>
               <p class="p Ctr" id="FAR_15_609__d976e14"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <em class="ph i">Use and Disclosure of Data</em>

               <p class="p" id="FAR_15_609__d976e17"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed-in whole or in part-for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. However, if a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of-or in connection with-the submission of these data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in these data if they are obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in Sheets [<em class="ph i">insert numbers or other identification of sheets</em>].</p>

						            The offeror shall also mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend: Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.</p>
            
            
               <p class="p" id="FAR_15_609__d976e28"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

						            The agency point of contact shall return to the offeror any unsolicited proposal marked with a legend different from that provided in paragraph (a) of this section. The return letter will state that the proposal cannot be considered because it is impracticable for the Government to comply with the legend and that the agency will consider the proposal if it is resubmitted with the proper legend.</p>

						            The agency point of contact shall place a cover sheet on the proposal or clearly mark it as follows, unless the offeror clearly states in writing that no restrictions are imposed on the disclosure or use of the data contained in the proposal:</p>

               <p class="p" id="FAR_15_609__d976e40"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All Government personnel must exercise extreme care to ensure that the information in this proposal is not disclosed to an individual who has not been authorized access to such data in accordance with FAR <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="3.104.html#FAR_3_104">3.104</a>, and is not duplicated, used, or disclosed in whole or in part for any purpose other than evaluation of the proposal, without the written permission of the offeror. If a contract is awarded on the basis of this proposal, the terms of the contract shall control disclosure and use. This notice does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in the proposal if it is obtainable from another source without restriction. This is a Government notice, and shall not by itself be construed to impose any liability upon the Government or Government personnel for disclosure or use of data contained in this proposal.</p>

						            Use the notice in paragraph (d) of this section solely as a manner of handling unsolicited proposals that will be compatible with this subpart. However, do not use this notice to justify withholding of a record, or to improperly deny the public access to a record, where an obligation is imposed by the Freedom of Information Act (<a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml;jsessionid=114A3287C7B3359E597506A31FC855B3" target="_blank">5 U.S.C. 552</a>).
