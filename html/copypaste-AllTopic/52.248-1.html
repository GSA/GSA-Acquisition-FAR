                  <em class="ph i">Collateral savings</em>. If a VECP is accepted, the Contracting Officer will increase the instant contract amount, as specified in paragraph (h)(5) of this clause, by a rate from 20 to 100 percent, as determined by the Contracting Officer, of any projected collateral savings determined to be realized in a typical year of use after subtracting any Government costs not previously offset. However, the Contractor’s share of collateral savings will not exceed the contract’s firm-fixed-price, target price, target cost, or estimated cost, at the time the VECP is accepted, or $100,000, whichever is greater. The Contracting Officer will be the sole determiner of the amount of collateral savings.</p>

However, the targets of such incentives affected by the VECP shall not be adjusted because of VECP acceptance. If this contract specifies targets but provides no incentive to surpass them, the value engineering sharing shall apply only to the amount of achievement better than target.</p>

In calculating any adjustment in this contract’s price for instant contract savings (or negative instant contract savings), the Contractor’s allowable development and implementation costs shall include any subcontractor’s allowable development and implementation costs, and any value engineering incentive payments to a subcontractor, clearly resulting from a VECP accepted by the Government under this contract.

In addition to being paid as the Schedule specifies for this mandatory program, the Contractor shall share in any net acquisition savings realized from VECP’s accepted under the program, in accordance with the program requirement sharing rates in paragraph (f) of this clause. For remaining areas of the contract, the Contractor is encouraged to develop, prepare, and submit VECP’s voluntarily; for VECP’s accepted under these remaining areas, the incentive sharing rates apply. The decision on which rate applies is a unilateral decision made solely at the discretion of the Government.</p>
