Authorization to settle proposals of lower tier subcontractors shall not be granted directly to subcontractors. However, a prime contractor authorized to approve subcontractor settlements may also exercise this authority in its capacity as a subcontractor, with respect to its terminated subcontracts and orders.

The TCO shall obtain the advice and recommendations of the appropriate audit agency and the cognizant plant clearance officer. When it is determined that the contractor’s procedures are not adequate, or that improper settlements are being made, or when the authority has not been used in the preceding 2 years, the TCO shall revoke the authorization by written notice to the contractor, effective on the date of receipt.</p>

						            The contractor may make any number of separate settlements with a single subcontractor but shall not divide settlement proposals solely to bring them under an authorization limit.
