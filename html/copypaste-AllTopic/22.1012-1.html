								                The Wage and Hour Administrator may issue revisions to prevailing wage determinations periodically. The need for inclusion of a revised prevailing wage determination in a solicitation, contract or contract modification (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="22.1007.html#FAR_22_1007">22.1007</a>) is determined by the date of receipt of the revised prevailing wage determination by the contracting agency. (Note the distinction between receipt by the agency and receipt by the contracting officer which may occur later.)</p>
                     
                        
                           <p class="p" id="FAR_22_1012_1__d1432e24"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

										                    For purposes of using WDOL, the time of receipt by the contracting agency shall be the first day of publication of the revised prevailing wage determination on the website.</p>

										                    For purposes of using the e98 process, the time of receipt by the contracting agency shall be the date the agency receives actual notice of a new or revised prevailing wage determination from the Department of Labor as an e98 response.</p>

								                In selecting a	prevailing wage determination from the WDOL website for use in a	solicitation or other contract action, the contracting officer shall	monitor the WDOL website to determine whether the applicable wage	determination has been revised. Revisions published on the WDOL	website or otherwise communicated to the contracting officer within	the timeframes prescribed at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#FAR_22_1012_1">22.1012-1</a>(b) and (c) are effective	and must be included in the resulting contract. Monitoring can be	accomplished by use of the WDOL websiteâ€™s "Alert Service".</p>

                  <span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span>
						            The following shall apply when contracting by sealed bidding: a revised prevailing wage determination shall not be effective if it is received by the contracting agency less than 10 days before the opening of bids, and the contracting officer finds that there is not reasonable time to incorporate the revision in the solicitation.</p>
            
            
               <p class="p" id="FAR_22_1012_1__d1432e47"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span>
						            For contractual actions other than sealed bidding, a revised prevailing wage determination received by the contracting agency after award of a new contract or a modification as specified in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="22.1007.html#FAR_22_1007">22.1007</a>(b) shall not be effective provided that the start of performance is within 30 days of the award or the specified modification. If the contract does not specify a start of performance date which is within 30 days of the award or the specified modification, and if contract performance does not commence within 30 days of the award or the specified modification, any revision received by the contracting agency not less than 10 days before commencement of the work shall be effective.</p>
            
            
               <p class="p" id="FAR_22_1012_1__d1432e55"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span>
						            If the contracting officer has submitted an e98 to the Department of Labor requesting a prevailing wage determination and has not received a response within 10 days, the contracting officer shall contact the Wage and Hour Division by telephone to determine when the wage determination can be expected. (The telephone number is provided on the e98 website.)</p>
