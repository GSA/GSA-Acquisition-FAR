If a cost contract for research and development with an educational

and (g) to the basic clause:</p>
            <p class="p List1">(e) If
a change in security requirements, as provided in paragraphs (b)
and (c), results (1)in a change in the security classification of
this contract or any of its elements from an unclassified status
or a lower classification to a higher classification, or (2)in more
restrictive area controls than previously required, the Contractor
shall exert every reasonable effort compatible with the Contractor’s
established policies to continue the performance of work under the
contract in compliance with the change in security classification
or requirements. If, despite reasonable efforts, the Contractor
determines that the continuation of work under this contract is
not practicable because of the change in security classification
or requirements, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer
in writing. Until resolution of the problem is made by the Contracting Officer,
the Contractor shall continue safeguarding all classified material
as required by this contract.</p>
            <p class="p List1">(f) After
receiving the written notification, the Contracting Officer shall
explore the circumstances surrounding the proposed change in security
classification or requirements, and shall endeavor to work out a
mutually satisfactory method whereby the Contractor can continue
performance of the work under this contract.</p>
            <p class="p List1">(g)
If, 15 days after receipt by the Contracting Officer of the notification
of the Contractor’s stated inability to proceed, (1) the application
to this contract of the change in security classification or requirements
has not been withdrawn, or (2)a mutually satisfactory method for
continuing performance of work under this contract has not been
agreed upon, the Contractor may request the Contracting Officer
to terminate the contract in whole or in part. The Contracting Officer
shall terminate the contract in whole or in part, as may be appropriate,
and the termination shall be deemed a termination under the terms
of the Termination for the Convenience of the Government clause.</p>

for furnishing to each employee and for requiring each employee
engaged on the work to display such identification as may be approved
