         <p class="p List1">(a)  <em class="ph i">Definitions</em>.  As used in this subsection—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  “Covered contract” means a DoD prime contract for an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, except for a fixed-price contract without cost incentives.  The term also includes a subcontract for an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, except for a fixed-price subcontract without cost incentives under such a prime contract.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  “Covered segment” means a product division of the contractor that allocated more than $1,100,000 in independent research and development and bid and proposal (IR&amp;D/B&amp;P) costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year.  In the case of a contractor that has no product divisions, the term means that contractor as a whole.  A product division of the contractor that allocated less than $1,100,000 in IR&amp;D/B&amp;P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year is not subject to the limitations in paragraph (c) of this subsection.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  “Major contractor” means any contractor whose covered segments allocated a total of more than $11,000,000 in IR&amp;D/B&amp;P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year.  For purposes of calculating the dollar threshold amounts to determine whether a contractor meets the definition of “major contractor,” do not include contractor segments allocating less than $1,100,000 of IR&amp;D/B&amp;P costs to covered contracts during the preceding fiscal year.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c)  <em class="ph i">Allowability</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  Departments/agencies shall not supplement this regulation in any way that limits IR&amp;D/B&amp;P cost allowability. </p>

         <p class="p List6">
            <em class="ph i">(1)</em>  Such contracts’ allocable share of total incurred IR&amp;D/B&amp;P costs; or</p>

            <em class="ph i">(1)</em>  Enable superior performance of future U.S. weapon systems and components.</p>

         <p class="p List4">(C)  For annual IR&amp;D costs to be allowable—</p>
         <p class="p List6">(1)  The IR&amp;D projects generating the costs must be reported to the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC) using the DTIC's on-line input form and instructions at http://www.defenseinnovationmarketplace.mil;</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>)  The inputs must be updated at least annually and when the project is completed;</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">3</em>)  Copies of the input and updates must be made available for review by the cognizant administrative contracting officer (ACO) and the cognizant Defense Contract Audit Agency auditor to support the allowability of the costs; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  Contractors not meeting the threshold of a major contractor are encouraged to use the DTIC online input form to report IR&amp;D projects to provide DoD with visibility into the technical content of the contractors' IR&amp;D activities.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v)  For major contractors, the ACO or corporate ACO shall—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Determine whether IR&amp;D/B&amp;P projects are of potential interest to DoD; and</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  Provide the results of the determination to the contractor.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vi)  The cognizant contract administration office shall furnish contractors with guidance on financial information needed to support IR&amp;D/B&amp;P costs and on technical information needed from major contractors to support the potential interest to DoD determination (also see <span class="ph DFARxref">
