mail is the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service postmark both on the
envelope or wrapper and on the original receipt from the U.S. or
Canadian Postal Service. Both postmarks must show a legible date
or the proposal, response to a request for information, or modification
or revision shall be processed as if mailed late. “Postmark” means
a printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression (exclusive of
a postage meter machine impression) that is readily identifiable
without further action as having been supplied and affixed by employees
of the U.S. or Canadian Postal Service on the date of mailing. Therefore,
offerors or respondents should request the postal clerk to place
a legible hand cancellation bull’s eye postmark on both the receipt
and the envelope or wrapper.</p>

                         &nbsp;The Government may determine
that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially
unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing
exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price
of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or
understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis
techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer
determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to
the Government.</p>

         <p class="GSAR     ">(4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals
and award a lease without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as
described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offeror’s initial proposal
should contain the offeror’s best terms from a cost or price and
technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct
discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to
be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number
of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds
the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the
Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive
range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition
among the most highly rated proposals.</p>
