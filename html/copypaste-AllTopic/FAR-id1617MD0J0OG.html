                  When professional or technical services are acquired on the basis of the number of hours to be provided, rather than on the task to be performed, the solicitation shall require offerors to identify uncompensated overtime hours and the uncompensated overtime rate for direct charge Fair Labor Standards Act-exempt personnel included in their proposals and subcontractor proposals. This includes uncompensated overtime hours that are in indirect cost pools for personnel whose regular hours are normally charged direct.</p>

                  Contracting officers must ensure that the use of uncompensated overtime in contracts to acquire services on the basis of the number of hours provided will not degrade the level of technical expertise required to fulfill the Governmentâ€™s requirements (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1108601.html#i1108601">15.305</a> for competitive negotiations and <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1106135.html#i1106135">15.404-1</a>(d) for cost realism analysis). When acquiring these services, contracting officers must conduct a risk assessment and evaluate, for award on that basis, any proposals received that reflect factors such as-</p>
