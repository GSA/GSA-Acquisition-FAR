                        <em class="ph i">Manufactured construction material</em>. The contracting officer must compare the offered price of the contract using foreign manufactured construction material (<em class="ph i">i.e.</em>, any construction material not manufactured in the United States, or construction material consisting predominantly of iron or steel and the iron or steel is not produced in the United States) to the estimated price if all domestic manufactured construction material were used.
