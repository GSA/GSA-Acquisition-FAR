The Contractor shall furnish, at its own expense, all stakes, templates, platforms, equipment, tools, materials, and labor required to lay out any part of the work. The Contractor shall be responsible for executing the work to the lines and grades that may be established or indicated by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall also be responsible for maintaining and preserving all stakes and other marks established by the Contracting Officer until authorized to remove them. If such marks are destroyed by the Contractor or through its negligence before their removal is authorized, the Contracting Officer may replace them and deduct the expense of the replacement from any amounts due or to become due to the Contractor.</p>
