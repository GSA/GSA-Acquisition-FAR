										                    If the proposal is found to be generally acceptable, the agency shall negotiate the predetermined rates with the institution.

If this is not possible, an earlier audit may be used, but appropriate steps should be taken to identify and evaluate significant variations in costs incurred or in bases used that may have a bearing on the reasonableness of the proposed rates.
