If the subcontract is awarded to a business unit which pursuant to <span class="ph CFR">48 CFR 9903.201-2</span> is subject to other types of CAS coverage, the substance of the applicable clause set forth in subsection <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="30.201-4.html#FAR_30_201_4">30.201-4</a> of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) shall be inserted. This requirement shall apply only to negotiated subcontracts in excess of the lower CAS threshold specified in FAR 30.201-4(b) on the date of subcontract award, except that the requirement shall not apply to negotiated subcontracts otherwise exempt from the requirement to include a CAS clause as specified in <span class="ph CFR">48 CFR 9903.201-1</span>.</p>
