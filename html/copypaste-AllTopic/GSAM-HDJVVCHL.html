you to provide information required by the format in accordance
with these instructions that is, to the best of your knowledge and
belief, current, accurate, and complete as of 14 calendar days prior
to its submission. You must also disclose any changes in your price
list(s), discounts and/or discounting policies which occur after
the offer is submitted, but before the close of negotiations. If
your discount practices vary by model or product line, the discount
information should be by model or product line as appropriate. You
