         <p class="p List1">(c) To comply with the certification requirement at DFARS <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="237.503.html#DFARS-237.503">237.503 Agency-head responsibilities.</a>, complete a certification substantially the same as the following and include a copy in the contract file:</p>
         <p class="p">Certification of Nonpersonal Services</p>
         <p class="p">This certification and enclosed worksheet is designed to ensure that the agency does not award a personal-services contract unless specifically authorized by statute (e.g., 10 U.S.C. 129b, 5 U.S.C. 3109, or 10 U.S.C. 1091). Therefore, this documentation should be completed in conjunction with the submission of a service-contract requirement to the contracting officer.</p>
         <p class="p">A personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor’s personnel. The Government is normally required to obtain its employees by direct hire under competitive appointment procedures required by civil service laws. Obtaining personal services by contract, rather than by direct hire, circumvents those laws unless Congress has specifically authorized acquisition of the services by contract. </p>
         <p class="p">An employer-employee relationship under a service contract occurs when the Government exercises relatively continuous supervision and control over contractor personnel performing the contract. </p>
         <p class="p">Upon considering the information above and the worksheet below, I certify that this requirement does not include an unauthorized personal services arrangement, either in the way the work statement is written or in the manner in which the resulting contract will be managed and overseen.</p>
