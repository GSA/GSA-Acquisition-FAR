and basic records relating thereto shall be maintained by the Contractor
during the course of the work and preserved for a period of 3 years
thereafter for all laborers and mechanics working at the site of
the work. Such records shall contain the name, address, and social
security number of each such worker, his or her correct classification,
hourly rates of wages paid (including rates of contributions or
costs anticipated for bona fide fringe benefits or cash equivalents thereof

Wage Rate Requirement statute)), daily and weekly number of hours
worked, deductions made, and actual wages paid. Whenever the Secretary
of Labor has found, under paragraph (d) of the clause entitled Construction
Wage Rate Requirements, that the wages of any laborer or mechanic include
the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits
under a plan or program described in <a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title40-section3141(2)(B)&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" target="_blank">40 U.S.C. 3141(2)(B)</a>,
the Contractor shall maintain records which show that the commitment
to provide such benefits is enforceable, that the plan or program
is financially responsible, and that the plan or program has been
communicated in writing to the laborers or mechanics affected, and
records which show the costs anticipated or the actual cost incurred
in providing such benefits. Contractors employing apprentices or
trainees under approved programs shall maintain written evidence
of the registration of apprenticeship programs and certification
of trainee programs, the registration of the apprentices and trainees,
and the ratios and wage rates prescribed in the applicable programs.</p>

Contractor shall submit weekly for each week in which any contract
work is performed a copy of all payrolls to the Contracting Officer.
The payrolls submitted shall set out accurately and completely all
of the information required to be maintained under paragraph (a)
of this clause, except that full social security numbers and home
addresses shall not be included on weekly transmittals. Instead
the payrolls shall only need to include an individually identifying number
for each employee (e.g., the last four digits of the employee’s
social security number). The required weekly payroll information
may be submitted in any form desired. Optional <a class="xref" href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/forms/wh347.pdf" target="_blank">Form&nbsp;WH-347</a> is available

Prime Contractor is responsible for the submission of copies of

Contracting Officer, the Contractor, or the Wage and Hour Division
of the Department of Labor for purposes of an investigation or audit

of this section for a Prime Contractor to require a subcontractor
to provide addresses and social security numbers to the Prime Contractor
