worked, deductions made, and actual wages paid. Whenever the Secretary
of Labor has found, under paragraph (d) of the clause entitled Construction
Wage Rate Requirements, that the wages of any laborer or mechanic include

to provide such benefits is enforceable, that the plan or program
is financially responsible, and that the plan or program has been
communicated in writing to the laborers or mechanics affected, and
records which show the costs anticipated or the actual cost incurred
in providing such benefits. Contractors employing apprentices or

The payrolls submitted shall set out accurately and completely all
of the information required to be maintained under paragraph (a)
of this clause, except that full social security numbers and home
addresses shall not be included on weekly transmittals. Instead
the payrolls shall only need to include an individually identifying number
for each employee (e.g., the last four digits of the employeeâ€™s
social security number). The required weekly payroll information
may be submitted in any form desired. Optional <a class="xref" href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/forms/wh347.pdf" target="_blank">Form&nbsp;WH-347</a> is available

of the Contracting Officer or the Department of Labor to interview
employees during working hours on the job. If the Contractor or subcontractor
fails to submit required records or to make them available, the
Contracting Officer may, after written notice to the Contractor,
take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of
any further payment. Furthermore, failure to submit the required
records upon request or to make such records available may be grounds
