practicable utilization of small business, veteran-owned small business,
service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and
women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in Government
contracts is a matter of national interest with both social and
economic benefits. When a contractor fails to make a good faith
effort to comply with a subcontracting plan, these objectives are
not achieved, and <a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title15-section637(d)(4)(F)&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" target="_blank">15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(F)</a> directs

                        In determining whether
a contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with its
subcontracting plan, a contracting officer must look to the totality
of the contractor's actions, consistent with the information and
assurances provided in its plan. The fact that the contractor failed
to meet its subcontracting goals does not, in and of itself, constitute
a failure to make a good faith effort (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="19.701.html#FAR_19_701">19.701</a>). For example,
notwithstanding a contractor's diligent effort to identify and solicit
offers from any of the small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled
veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged
business, and women-owned small business concerns, factors such
as unavailability of anticipated sources or unreasonable prices
may frustrate achievement of the contractor's subcontracting goals.
The contracting officer may consider any of the following, though
not all inclusive, to be indicators of a good faith effort:

assess liquidated damages on the Government’s behalf, based on the
pro rata share of subcontracting attributable to the Government
contracts. For example: The contractor’s total actual sales were
$50 million and its actual subcontracting was $20 million. The Government’s
total payments under contracts subject to the plan contributing
to the contractor’s total sales were $5 million, which accounted
for 10 percent of the contractor’s total sales. Therefore, the pro
rata share of subcontracting attributable to the Government contracts
would be 10 percent of $20 million, or $2 million. To continue the
example, if the contractor failed to achieve its small business
goal by 1 percent, the liquidated damages would be calculated as
1 percent of $2 million, or $20,000. The contracting officer shall
make similar calculations for each category of small business where
the contractor failed to achieve its goal and the sum of the dollars
for all of the categories equals the amount of the liquidated damages
to be assessed. A copy of the contracting officer’s final decision
assessing liquidated damages shall be provided to other contracting
officers with contracts subject to the commercial plan.</p>
