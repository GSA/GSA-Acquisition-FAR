If the contracting officer believes a violation exists (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="22.406-8.html#FAR_22_406_8">22.406-8</a>), or upon request of the Department of Labor, the contracting officer must withhold from payments due the contractor an amount equal to the estimated wage underpayment and estimated liquidated damages due the United States under the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards statute.
