as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency,
consistent with efficient contract performance. The Small Business
Administration (SBA) counsels and assists small business concerns
and assists contracting personnel to ensure that a fair proportion
of contracts for supplies and services is placed with small business.</p>
