						            Contracting officers are responsible for transmitting offeror responses to the solicitation provision at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="52.207-4.html#FAR_52_207_4">52.207-4</a> to appropriate inventory management/requirements development activities in accordance with agency procedures. The economic purchase quantity data so obtained are intended to assist inventory managers in establishing and evaluating economic order quantities for supplies under their cognizance.</p>
            
            
               <p class=" ListL1" id="FAR_7_204__d433e18">
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span>
                  
						            In recognition of the fact that economic purchase quantity data furnished by offerors are only one of many data inputs required for determining the most economical order quantities, contracting officers should generally take no action to revise quantities to be acquired in connection with the instant procurement. However, if a significant price variation is evident from offeror responses, and the potential for significant savings is apparent, the contracting officer shall consult with the cognizant inventory manager or requirements development activity before proceeding with an award or negotiations. If this consultation discloses that the Government should be ordering an item of supply in different quantities and the inventory manager/requirements development activity concurs, the solicitation for the item should be amended or canceled and a new requisition should be obtained.</p>
