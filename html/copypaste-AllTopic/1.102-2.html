                         The
principal customers for the product or service provided by the System
are the users and line managers, acting on behalf of the American
taxpayer.</p>

                         The System
must be responsive and adaptive to customer needs, concerns, and
feedback. Implementation of acquisition policies and procedures,
as well as consideration of timeliness, quality, and cost throughout
the process, must take into account the perspective of the user
of the product or service.</p>

                         When selecting
contractors to provide products or perform services, the Government
will use contractors who have a track record of successful past
performance or who demonstrate a current superior ability to perform.</p>
                  
                  
                     <p class=" ListL2" id="FAR_1_102_2__d13e31">
                        <span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> The Government must not hesitate to communicate with industry as early as possible in the acquisition cycle to help the Government determine the capabilities available in the marketplace. Government acquisition personnel are permitted and encouraged to engage in responsible and constructive exchanges with industry ( e.g., see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="10.002.html#FAR_10_002">10.002</a> and <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="15.201.html#FAR_15_201">15.201</a>), so long as those exchanges are consistent with existing laws and regulations, and do not promote an unfair competitive advantage to particular firms. </p>

                        The Government will maximize its use of commercial products and commercial services in meeting Government requirements.

                         It is the
policy of the System to promote competition in the acquisition process.</p>

                         All members
of the Team are required to employ planning as an integral part
of the overall process of acquiring products or services. Although
advance planning is required, each member of the Team must be flexible
in order to accommodate changing or unforeseen mission needs. Planning
is a tool for the accomplishment of tasks, and application of its
discipline should be commensurate with the size and nature of a
given task.</p>

                         In order to
ensure that maximum efficiency is obtained, rules, regulations,
and policies should be promulgated only when their benefits clearly
exceed the costs of their development, implementation, administration,
and enforcement. This applies to internal administrative processes,
including reviews, and to rules and procedures applied to the contractor
community.</p>

                         The System
must provide uniformity where it contributes to efficiency or where
fairness or predictability is essential. The System should also,
however, encourage innovation, and local adaptation where uniformity
is not essential.</p>

                   Conduct
business with integrity, fairness, and openness.</p>

                         An essential
consideration in every aspect of the System is maintaining the public’s
trust. Not only must the System have integrity, but the actions
of each member of the Team must reflect integrity, fairness, and
openness. The foundation of integrity within the System is a competent,
experienced, and well-trained, professional workforce. Accordingly,
each member of the Team is responsible and accountable for the wise
use of public resources as well as acting in a manner which maintains
the public’s trust. Fairness and openness require open communication
among team members, internal and external customers, and the public.</p>
                  
                  
                     <p class=" ListL2" id="FAR_1_102_2__d13e78">

                         To achieve
efficient operations, the System must shift its focus from "risk
avoidance" to one of "risk management." The cost to the taxpayer
of attempting to eliminate all risk is prohibitive. The Executive
Branch will accept and manage the risk associated with empowering
local procurement officials to take independent action based on
their professional judgment.</p>

                         The Government
shall exercise discretion, use sound business judgment, and comply
with applicable laws and regulations in dealing with contractors
and prospective contractors. All contractors and prospective contractors
shall be treated fairly and impartially but need not be treated
the same.</p>
