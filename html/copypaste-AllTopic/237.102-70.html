         <p class="p List1">(b)  Under Section 2907 of Pub. L. 103-160, this prohibition does not apply to services at installations being closed (see Subpart 237.74).</p>

         <p class="p List4">(C)  Performance of such functions will not result in a reduction in the security of the installation or facility; </p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  Contract performance will not extend beyond September 30, 2012; and  </p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  The total number of personnel employed to perform security-guard functions under all contracts entered into pursuant to this authority does not exceed the following limitations:</p>
