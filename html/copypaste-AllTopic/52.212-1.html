threshold, and offers at or below the micro-purchase threshold if
the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the
System for Award Management (SAM).) The Offeror shall enter, in
the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer,
the annotation "Unique Entity Identifier" followed by the unique
entity identifier that identifies the Offeror's name and address.
The Offeror also shall enter its Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)
indicator, if applicable. The EFT indicator is a four-character suffix
to the unique entity identifier. The suffix is assigned at the discretion
of the Offeror to establish additional SAM records for identifying
alternative EFT accounts (see FAR <a class="xref fm:Subpart" href="Subpart_32.11.html#FAR_Subpart_32_11">subpart&nbsp; 32.11</a>) for
the same entity. If the Offeror does not have a unique entity identifier,
it should contact the entity designated at <a class="xref" href="http://www.sam.gov" target="_blank">www.sam.gov</a> for
unique entity identifier establishment directly to obtain one. The
Offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a Government contract
when contacting the entity designated at <a class="xref" href="http://www.sam.gov" target="_blank">www.sam.gov</a> for
establishing the unique entity identifier.</p>
