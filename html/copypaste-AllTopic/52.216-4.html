Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer if, at any time
during contract performance, the rate of pay for labor (including
fringe benefits) or the unit prices for material shown in the Schedule
either increase or decrease. The Contractor shall furnish this notice
within 60 days after the increase or decrease, or within any additional
period that the Contracting Officer may approve in writing, but
not later than the date of final payment under this contract. The
notice shall include the Contractor’s proposal for an adjustment
in the contract unit prices to be negotiated under paragraph (b)
of this clause, and shall include, in the form required by the Contracting
Officer, supporting data explaining the cause, effective date, and
amount of the increase or decrease and the amount of the Contractor’s
adjustment proposal.</p>

after the Contracting Officer receives the notice and data under
paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contracting Officer and the Contractor
shall negotiate a price adjustment in the contract unit prices and
its effective date. However, the Contracting Officer may postpone
the negotiations until an accumulation of increases and decreases
in the labor rates (including fringe benefits) and unit prices of
material shown in the Schedule results in an adjustment allowable
under paragraph (c)(3) of this clause. The Contracting Officer shall
modify this contract (1)to include the price adjustment and its effective
date and (2)to revise the labor rates (including fringe benefits)
or unit prices of material as shown in the Schedule to reflect the
increases or decreases resulting from the adjustment. The Contractor
shall continue performance pending agreement on, or determination
of, any adjustment and its effective date.</p>
