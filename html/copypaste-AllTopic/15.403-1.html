The head of the contracting activity (HCA) may, without power of
delegation, waive the requirement for submission of certified cost
or pricing data in exceptional cases. The authorization for the
waiver and the supporting rationale shall be in writing. The HCA
may consider waiving the requirement if the price can be determined
to be fair and reasonable without submission of certified cost or
pricing data. For example, if certified cost or pricing data were furnished
on previous production buys and the contracting officer determines
such data are sufficient, when combined with updated data, a waiver
may be granted. If the HCA has waived the requirement for submission
of certified cost or pricing data, the contractor or higher-tier
subcontractor to whom the waiver relates shall be considered as
having been required to provide certified cost or pricing data.
Consequently, award of any lower-tier subcontract expected to exceed
the certified cost or pricing data threshold requires the submission
of certified cost or pricing data unless-</p>
