         <p class="p List2">(3)  Must result from an unusually hazardous risk as specifically defined in the contract;</p>

         <p class="p List1">(d)  A reduction of the insurance coverage maintained by the Contractor on the date of the execution of this contract shall not increase the Government's liability under this clause unless the Contracting Officer consents, and the contract price is equitably adjusted, if appropriate, to reflect the Contractor's consideration for the Government's assumption of increased liability.</p>
