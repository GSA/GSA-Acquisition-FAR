to terminate a contract for commercial
products or commercial services either for the convenience
of the Government or for cause. However, the paragraphs in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="52.212-4.html#FAR_52_212_4">52.212-4</a> entitled "Termination
for the Government’s Convenience" and "Termination for Cause" contain
concepts which differ from those contained in the termination clauses
prescribed in <a class="xref fm:Part" href="Part_49.html#FAR_Part_49">part&nbsp; 49</a>. Consequently,
the requirements of <a class="xref fm:Part" href="Part_49.html#FAR_Part_49">part&nbsp; 49</a> do
not apply when terminating contracts for commercial products or
commercial services and contracting officers shall follow the
procedures in this section. Contracting officers may continue to
use <a class="xref fm:Part" href="Part_49.html#FAR_Part_49">part&nbsp; 49</a> as guidance
to the extent that <a class="xref fm:Part" href="Part_49.html#FAR_Part_49">part&nbsp; 49</a> does
not conflict with this section and the language of the termination
paragraphs in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="52.212-4.html#FAR_52_212_4">52.212-4</a>.</p>

The contracting officer should exercise the Government’s right to
terminate a contract for commercial
products or commercial services either for convenience or for
cause only when such a termination would be in the best interests of
the Government. The contracting officer should consult with counsel

this requirement should eliminate the need for a show cause notice
