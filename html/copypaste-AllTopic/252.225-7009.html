         <p class="p List6">
            <em class="ph i">(2)</em> The fasteners qualify for the
commercial item exception in paragraph (c)(3) of this clause.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) A COTS item is considered to be “without
modification” if it is not modified prior to contractual acceptance
by the next higher tier in the supply chain.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Specialty metals in a COTS item that
was accepted without modification by the next higher tier are excepted from
the restriction in paragraph (b) of this clause, and remain excepted,
even if a piece of the COTS item subsequently is removed (e.g.,
the end is removed from a COTS screw or an extra hole is drilled
in a COTS bracket).</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Specialty metals that were not contained
in a COTS item upon acceptance, but are added to the COTS item after acceptance,
are subject to the restriction in paragraph (b) of this clause (e.g.,
a special reinforced handle made of specialty metal is added to
a COTS item).</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) If two or more COTS items are combined
in such a way that the resultant item is not a COTS item, only the specialty
metals involved in joining the COTS items together are subject to
the restriction in paragraph (b) of this clause (e.g., a COTS aircraft
is outfitted with a COTS engine that is not the COTS engine normally
provided with the aircraft).</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) For COTS items that are normally sold
in the commercial marketplace with various options, items that include such
options are also COTS items. However, if a COTS item is offered
to the Government with an option that is not normally offered in
the commercial marketplace, that option is subject to the restriction
in paragraph (b) of this clause (e.g. - An aircraft is normally
sold to the public with an option for installation kits. The Department of
Defense requests a military-unique kit. The aircraft is still a
COTS item, but the military-unique kit is not a COTS item and must
comply with the restriction in paragraph (b) of this clause unless
another exception applies).</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Fasteners that are commercial items,
if the manufacturer of the fasteners certifies it will purchase,
during the relevant calendar year, an amount of domestically melted
or produced specialty metal, in the required form, for use in the
production of fasteners for sale to the Department of Defense and
other customers, that is not less than 50 percent of the total amount
of the specialty metal that it will purchase to carry out the production
of such fasteners for all customers.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Items manufactured in a qualifying
country.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Specialty metals for which the Government
has determined in accordance with DFARS <span class="ph DFARxref">

            </span> that specialty
metal melted or produced in the United States, its outlying areas,
or a qualifying country cannot be acquired as and when needed in—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) A satisfactory quality;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) A sufficient quantity; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) The required form. In accordance
with 10 U.S.C. 2533b(m)(4), the term “required form” in this clause
refers to the form of the mill product, such as bar, billet, wire,
slab, plate, or sheet, in the grade appropriate for the production of
a finished end item to be delivered to the Government under this
contract; or a finished component assembled into an end item to
be delivered to the Government under this contract.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) End items containing a minimal amount
of otherwise noncompliant specialty metals (i.e., specialty metals
not melted or produced in the United States, an outlying area, or
a qualifying country, that are not covered by one of the other exceptions
in this paragraph (c)), if the total weight of such noncompliant
metals does not exceed 2 percent of the total weight of all specialty
metals in the end item, as estimated in good faith by the Contractor.
This exception does not apply to high performance magnets containing
specialty metals.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Compliance for commercial derivative
military articles</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) As an alternative to the compliance
required in paragraph (b) of this clause, the Contractor may purchase
an amount of domestically melted or produced specialty metals in
the required form, for use during the period of contract performance
in the production of the commercial derivative military article
and the related commercial article, if—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The Contracting Officer has notified
the Contractor of the items to be delivered under this contract
that have been determined by the Government to meet the definition
of “commercial derivative military article”; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) For each item that has been determined
by the Government to meet the definition of “commercial derivative
military article,” the Contractor has certified, as specified in
the provision of the solicitation entitled “Commercial Derivative Military
Article—Specialty Metals Compliance Certificate” (DFARS <span class="ph DFARxref">
               <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="252.225-7010.html#DFARS-252.225-7010">252.225-7010</a>
            </span>), that
the Contractor and its subcontractor(s) will enter into a contractual
agreement or agreements to purchase an amount of domestically melted or
produced specialty metal in the required form, for use during the
period of contract performance in the production of each commercial
derivative military article and the related commercial article,
that is not less than the Contractor’s good faith estimate of the
greater of—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) An amount equivalent to 120 percent
of the amount of specialty metal that is required to carry out the
production of the commercial derivative military article (including
the work performed under each subcontract); or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) An amount equivalent to 50 percent
of the amount of specialty metal that will be purchased by the Contractor and
its subcontractors for use during such period in the production
of the commercial derivative military article and the related commercial
article.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) For the purposes of this alternative,
the amount of specialty metal that is required to carry out production
of the commercial derivative military article includes specialty
metal contained in any item, including COTS items.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Subcontracts.</em>
         </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The Contractor shall exclude and reserve
paragraph (d) and this paragraph (e)(1) when flowing down this clause
to subcontracts.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The Contractor shall insert paragraphs
(a) through (c) and this paragraph (e)(2) of this clause in subcontracts,
including subcontracts for commercial items, that are for items
containing specialty metals to ensure compliance of the end products
that the Contractor will deliver to the Government. When inserting
this clause in subcontracts, the Contractor shall—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Modify paragraph (c)(6) of this clause
only as necessary to facilitate management of the minimal content
exception at the prime contract level. The minimal content exception
does not apply to specialty metals contained in high-performance
magnets; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Not further alter the clause other
than to identify the appropriate parties.</p>
