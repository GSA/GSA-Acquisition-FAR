         <p class="p Ctr_SmCaps">CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SUPPORTING U.S. ARMED FORCES DEPLOYED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES (OCT 2015)</p>
         <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Definitions</em>. As used in this clause—</p>
         <p class="p">“Combatant Commander” means the commander of a unified or specified combatant command established in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 161.</p>
         <p class="p">“Contractors authorized to accompany the Force,” or “CAAF,” means contractor personnel, including all tiers of subcontractor personnel, who are authorized to accompany U.S. Armed Forces in applicable operations and have been afforded CAAF status through a letter of authorization. CAAF generally include all U.S. citizen n and third-country national employees not normally residing within the operational area whose area of performance is in the direct vicinity of U.S. Armed Forces and who routinely are collocated with the U.S. Armed Forces (especially in non-permissive environments). Personnel collocated with U.S. Armed Forces shall be afforded CAAF status through a letter of authorization. In some cases, Combatant Commander subordinate commanders may designate mission-essential host nation or local national contractor employees (e.g., interpreters) as CAAF. CAAF includes contractors previously identified as contractors deploying with the U.S. Armed Forces. CAAF status does not apply to contractor personnel in support of applicable operations within the boundaries and territories of the United States.</p>
         <p class="p">“Designated operational area” means a geographic area designated by the combatant commander or subordinate joint force commander for the conduct or support of specified military operations.</p>
         <p class="p">“Designated reception site” means the designated place for the reception, staging, integration, and onward movement of contractors deploying during a contingency. The designated reception site includes assigned joint reception centers and other Service or private reception sites.</p>
         <p class="p">“Law of war” means that part of international law that regulates the conduct of armed hostilities. The law of war encompasses all international law for the conduct of hostilities binding on the United States or its individual citizens, including treaties and international agreements to which the United States is a party, and applicable customary international law.</p>
         <p class="p">“Non-CAAF” means personnel who are not designated as CAAF, such as local national (LN) employees and non-LN employees who are permanent residents in the operational area or third-country nationals not routinely residing with U.S. Armed Forces (and third-country national expatriates who are permanent residents in the operational area) who perform support functions away from the close proximity of, and do not reside with, U.S. Armed Forces. Government-furnished support to non-CAAF is typically limited to force protection, emergency medical care, and basic human needs (e.g., bottled water, latrine facilities, security, and food when necessary) when performing their jobs in the direct vicinity of U.S. Armed Forces. Non-CAAF status does not apply to contractor personnel in support of applicable operations within the boundaries and territories of the United States.</p>
         <p class="p Footnotetext">“Subordinate joint force commander” means a sub-unified commander or joint task force commander.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">General</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) This clause applies to both CAAF and non-CAAF when performing in a designated operational area outside the United States to support U.S. Armed Forces deployed outside the United States in—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Contingency operations;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Peace operations, consistent with Joint Publication 3-07.3; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Other military operations or military exercises, when designated by the Combatant Commander or as directed by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Contract performance in support of U.S. Armed Forces deployed outside the United States may require work in dangerous or austere conditions. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Contractor accepts the risks associated with required contract performance in such operations.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) When authorized in accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause to carry arms for personal protection, Contractor personnel are only authorized to use force for individual self-defense.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Unless immune from host nation jurisdiction by virtue of an international agreement or international law, inappropriate use of force by contractor personnel supporting the U.S. Armed Forces can subject such personnel to United States or host nation prosecution and civil liability (see paragraphs (d) and (j)(3) of this clause).</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Service performed by Contractor personnel subject to this clause is not active duty or service under 38 U.S.C. 106 note.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(2)(i) Generally, CAAF will be afforded emergency medical and dental care if injured while supporting applicable operations. Additionally, non-CAAF employees who are injured while in the vicinity of U. S. Armed Forces will normally receive emergency medical and dental care. Emergency medical and dental care includes medical care situations in which life, limb, or eyesight is jeopardized. Examples of emergency medical and dental care include examination and initial treatment of victims of sexual assault; refills of prescriptions for life-dependent drugs; repair of broken bones, lacerations, infections; and traumatic injuries to the dentition. Hospitalization will be limited to stabilization and short-term medical treatment with an emphasis on return to duty or placement in the patient movement system.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(ii) Provisions of the law of war, as well as any other applicable treaties and international agreements;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) United States regulations, directives, instructions, policies, and procedures; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Orders, directives, and instructions issued by the Combatant Commander, including those relating to force protection, security, health, safety, or relations and interaction with local nationals.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The Contractor shall institute and implement an effective program to prevent violations of the law of war by its employees and subcontractors, including law of war training in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(vii) of this clause.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(ii) That the offenses addressed by the definition are covered under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (see paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this clause). Other sexual misconduct may constitute offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Federal law, such as the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, or host nation laws; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) That the offenses not covered by the Uniform Code of Military Justice may nevertheless have consequences to the contractor employees (see paragraph (h)(1) of this clause).</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) The Contractor shall report to the appropriate investigative authorities, identified in paragraph (d)(6) of this clause, any alleged offenses under—</p>

         <p class="p List3">(ii) The Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (chapter 212 of title 18, United States Code).</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) The Contractor shall provide to all contractor personnel who will perform work on a contract in the deployed area, before beginning such work, information on the following:</p>
