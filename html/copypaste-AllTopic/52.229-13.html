(the Agreement) between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (Afghanistan)

than those that are Afghan legal entities or residents), from paying
any tax or similar charge assessed by the Government of Afghanistan
on activities associated with this contract within Afghanistan if
the activities are on behalf of or in support of U.S. Forces. The
Agreement also exempts the acquisition, importation, exportation,
reexportation, transportation, and use of supplies and services
