                  <em class="ph i">General.</em> This paragraph prescribes procedures for the use of the broad agency announcement (BAA) with Peer or Scientific Review (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="6.102.html#FAR_6_102">6.102</a>(d)(2)) for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement. BAA’s may be used by agencies to fulfill their requirements for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution. The BAA technique shall only be used when meaningful proposals with varying technical/scientific approaches can be reasonably anticipated.</p>

						            The availability of the BAA must be publicized through the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE) and, if authorized pursuant to <a class="xref fm:Subpart" href="Subpart_5.5.html#FAR_Subpart_5_5">subpart&nbsp; 5.5</a>, may also be published in noted scientific, technical, or engineering periodicals. The notice must be published no less frequently than annually.</p>

						            Proposals received as a result of the BAA shall be evaluated in accordance with evaluation criteria specified therein through a peer or scientific review process. Written evaluation reports on individual proposals will be necessary but proposals need not be evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common work statement.</p>

						            The primary basis for selecting proposals for acceptance shall be technical, importance to agency programs, and fund availability. Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate.</p>
