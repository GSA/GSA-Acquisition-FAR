						            Government contract quality assurance on subcontracted supplies or services shall be performed only when required in the Government’s interest.

It does not relieve the prime contractor of any responsibilities under the contract. When appropriate, the prime contractor shall be requested to arrange for timely Government access to the subcontractor facility.</p>
