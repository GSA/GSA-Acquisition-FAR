A time-and-materials contract may be used only when it is not possible
at the time of placing the contract to estimate accurately the extent
or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable
degree of confidence. See <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="12.207.html#FAR_12_207">12.207</a>(b)

A time-and-materials contract provides no positive profit incentive
to the contractor for cost control or labor efficiency. Therefore,
appropriate Government surveillance of contractor performance is
required to give reasonable assurance that efficient methods and
effective cost controls are being used.</p>
