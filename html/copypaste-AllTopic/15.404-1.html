                        The Air Force
Institute of Technology (AFIT) and the Federal Acquisition Institute
(FAI) jointly prepared a five-volume set of Contract Pricing Reference
Guides to guide pricing and negotiation personnel. The five guides
are: I Price Analysis, II Quantitative Techniques for Contract Pricing,
III Cost Analysis, IV Advanced Issues in Contract Pricing, and V
Federal Contract Negotiation Techniques. These references provide
detailed discussion and examples applying pricing policies to pricing
problems. They are to be used for instruction and professional guidance.
However, they are not directive and should be considered informational
only. They are available via the internet at <a class="xref" href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/cpic/cp/contract_pricing_reference_guides.html" target="_blank">http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/cpic/cp/contract_pricing_reference_guides.html</a>.</p>

                        Price analysis
is the process of examining and evaluating a proposed price without
evaluating its separate cost elements and proposed profit. Unless
an exception from the requirement to obtain certified cost or pricing
data applies under <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="15.403-1.html#FAR_15_403_1">15.403-1</a>(b)(1)
or (b)(2), at a minimum, the contracting officer shall obtain appropriate
data, without certification, on the prices at which the same or
similar items have previously been sold and determine if the data
is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price. Price
analysis may include evaluating data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from the offeror or contractor when there is
no other means for determining a fair and reasonable price. Contracting
officers shall obtain data other than certified cost or pricing
data from the offeror or contractor for all acquisitions (including
commercial item acquisitions), if that is the contracting officer’s
only means to determine the price to be fair and reasonable.</p>

                        The Government
may use various price analysis techniques and procedures to ensure
a fair and reasonable price. Examples of such techniques include,
but are not limited to, the following:</p>
                     
                        
                           <p class="p" id="FAR_15_404_1__d938e79"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

                              Comparison of
proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. Normally,
adequate price competition establishes a fair and reasonable price
(see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="15.403-1.html#FAR_15_403_1">15.403-1</a>(c)(1)).</p>

                              Comparison
of the proposed prices to historical prices paid, whether by the
Government or other than the Government, for the same or similar
items. This method may be used for commercial items including those
"of a type" or requiring minor modifications.</p>

                                    The prior
price must be a valid basis for comparison. If there has been a
significant time lapse between the last acquisition and the present
one, if the terms and conditions of the acquisition are significantly
different, or if the reasonableness of the prior price is uncertain,
then the prior price may not be a valid basis for comparison.</p>

                                    The prior
price must be adjusted to account for materially differing terms
and conditions, quantities and market and economic factors. For
similar items, the contracting officer must also adjust the prior
price to account for material differences between the similar item
and the item being procured.</p>
