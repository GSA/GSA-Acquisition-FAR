analysis is the process of examining and evaluating a proposed price
without evaluating its separate cost elements and proposed profit.
Unless an exception from the requirement to obtain certified cost
or pricing data applies under <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="15.403-1.html#FAR_15_403_1">15.403-1</a>(b)(1)
or (b)(2), at a minimum, the contracting officer shall obtain appropriate
data, without certification, on the prices at which the same or
similar items have previously been sold and determine if the data is
adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price. Price analysis
may include evaluating data other than certified cost or pricing
data obtained from the offeror or contractor when there is no other
means for determining a fair and reasonable price. Contracting officers
shall obtain data other than certified cost or pricing data from
the offeror or contractor for all acquisitions (including commercial acquisitions),
if that is the contracting officer’s only means to determine the
price to be fair and reasonable.</p>
