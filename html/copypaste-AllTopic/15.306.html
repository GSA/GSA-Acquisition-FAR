with offerors after establishment of the competitive range</em>.
Negotiations are exchanges, in either a competitive or sole source
environment, between the Government and offerors, that are undertaken
with the intent of allowing the offeror to revise its proposal.
These negotiations may include bargaining. Bargaining includes persuasion,
alteration of assumptions and positions, give-and-take, and may
apply to price, schedule, technical requirements, type of contract, or
other terms of a proposed contract. When negotiations are conducted
in a competitive acquisition, they take place after establishment
of the competitive range and are called discussions.</p>

to, or discuss with, each offeror still being considered for award,
deficiencies, significant weaknesses, and adverse past performance
information to which the offeror has not yet had an opportunity
to respond. The contracting officer also is encouraged to discuss
other aspects of the offeror’s proposal that could, in the opinion
of the contracting officer, be altered or explained to enhance materially
the proposal’s potential for award. However, the contracting officer
is not required to discuss every area where the proposal could be
improved. The scope and extent of discussions are a matter of contracting

other aspects of the proposal, the Government may, in situations

mandatory minimums (in ways that are not integral to the design),
that their proposals would be more competitive if the excesses were
