						            Oral presentations by offerors as requested by the Government may substitute for, or augment, written information. Use of oral presentations as a substitute for portions of a proposal can be effective in streamlining the source selection process. Oral presentations may occur at any time in the acquisition process, and are subject to the same restrictions as written information, regarding timing (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="15.208.html#FAR_15_208">15.208</a>) and content (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="15.306.html#FAR_15_306">15.306</a>). Oral presentations provide an opportunity for dialogue among the parties. Pre-recorded videotaped presentations that lack real-time interactive dialogue are not considered oral presentations for the purposes of this section, although they may be included in offeror submissions, when appropriate.</p>

						            The solicitation may require each offeror to submit part of its proposal through oral presentations. However, representations and certifications shall be submitted as required in the FAR provisions at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="52.204-8.html#FAR_52_204_8">52.204-8</a>(d) or <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="52.212-3.html#FAR_52_212_3">52.212-3</a>(b), and a signed offer sheet (including any exceptions to the Government’s terms and conditions) shall be submitted in writing.</p>

						            Information pertaining to areas such as an offeror’s capability, past performance, work plans or approaches, staffing resources, transition plans, or sample tasks (or other types of tests) may be suitable for oral presentations. In deciding what information to obtain through an oral presentation, consider the following:</p>
               
                  
                     <p class=" ListL2" id="FAR_15_102__d899e38">

								                The impact (including cost) on small businesses. In considering the costs of oral presentations, contracting officers should also consider alternatives to on-site oral presentations (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> teleconferencing, video teleconferencing).</p>

The method and level of detail of the record (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> videotaping, audio tape recording, written record, Government notes, copies of offeror briefing slides or presentation notes) shall be at the discretion of the source selection authority. A copy of the record placed in the file may be provided to the offeror.</p>

						            When an oral presentation includes information that the parties intend to include in the contract as material terms or conditions, the information shall be put in writing. Incorporation by reference of oral statements is not permitted.</p>
