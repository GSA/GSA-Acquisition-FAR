its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant
in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts,
and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part

a concern is “not dominant in its field of operation” when it does
not exercise a controlling or major influence on a national basis
in a kind of business activity in which a number of business concerns
are primarily engaged. In determining whether dominance exists,
consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including
volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status
or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents,
license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business
activity.
