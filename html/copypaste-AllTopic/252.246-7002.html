         <p class="p List1">(c)  The Contractor shall remedy, at the Contractor’s expense, any failure to conform or any defect.  In addition, the Contractor shall remedy, at the Contractor’s expense, any damage to Government-owned or -controlled real or personal property when that damage is the result of—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  The Contractor’s failure to conform to contract requirements; or</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Any defect of equipment, material, or design furnished or workmanship performed.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(f)  If the Contractor fails to remedy any failure, defect, or damage within a reasonable period of time after receipt of notice, the Government shall have the right to replace, repair, or otherwise remedy the failure, defect, or damage at the Contractor’s expense.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g)  With respect to all warranties, express or implied, from subcontractors, manufacturers, or suppliers for work performed and materials furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall—</p>

         <p class="p List1">(j)  This warranty shall not limit the Government’s right under the Inspection clause of this contract, with respect to latent defects, gross mistakes, or fraud.</p>
