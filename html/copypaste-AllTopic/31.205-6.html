The application of the provisions of a labor-management agreement designed to apply to a given set of circumstances and conditions of employment (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> work involving extremely hazardous activities or work not requiring recurrent use of overtime) is unwarranted when applied to a Government contract involving significantly different circumstances and conditions of employment (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> work involving less hazardous activities or work continually requiring use of overtime).
