surety's assets based upon substantial performance of the contractor's
obligations under its performance bond. Release of the security
interest in support of a payment bond must comply with the subparagraphs
(a)(1) through (3) of this section. In making this determination,
the contracting officer will give consideration as to whether the
unreleased portion of the security is sufficient to cover the remaining
contract obligations, including payments to subcontractors and other
potential liabilities. The individual surety shall, as a condition
of the partial release, furnish an affidavit agreeing that the release
of such assets does not relieve the individual surety of its obligations
under the bond(s).</p>
