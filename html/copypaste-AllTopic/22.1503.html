						            When issuing a solicitation for	supplies expected to exceed the micro-purchase threshold, the contracting	officer must check the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification	as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor (the List) ( <a class="xref" href="http://www.dol.gov/ilab/" target="_blank">www.dol.gov/ilab/</a>)	(see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="22.1505.html#FAR_22_1505">22.1505</a>(a)). Appearance	of a product on the List is not a bar to purchase of any such product mined,	produced, or manufactured in the identified country, but rather	is an alert that there is a reasonable basis to believe that such	product may have been mined, produced, or  manufactured <em class="ph i">test</em> by	forced or indentured child  labor.</p>

										                    It	has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured	child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any end product	to be furnished under the contract that is on the List and was mined,	produced, or manufactured in a country identified on the List for	that product; and</p>

						            Whenever	a contracting officer has reason to believe that forced or indentured	child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture an end product	furnished pursuant to a contract awarded subject to the certification	required in paragraph (c) of this section, the contracting officer	must refer the matter for investigation by the agency’s Inspector	General, the Attorney General, or the Secretary of the Treasury,	whichever is determined appropriate in accordance with agency procedures,	except to the extent that the end product is from the country listed	in paragraph (b) of this section, under a contract exceeding the	applicable threshold.</p>
