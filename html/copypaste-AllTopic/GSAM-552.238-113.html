Payment by Third Party. If the Contractor is unwilling to accept
such orders, and the proposed method of payment is not through the
Credit Card, the Contractor shall return the order by mail or other
means of delivery within 5 workdays from receipt. If the Contractor
is unwilling to accept such orders, and the proposed method of payment
is through the Credit Card, the Contractor must so advise the ordering
activity within 24 hours of receipt of order. (Reference clause
52.232-36 Payment by Third Party.) Failure to return an order or
advise the ordering activity within the time frames of this paragraph
shall constitute acceptance whereupon all provisions of the contract
shall apply.</p>
