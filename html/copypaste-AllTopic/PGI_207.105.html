correlate the plan to the DoD Future Years Defense Program, applicable
budget submissions, and the decision coordinating paper/program
memorandum, as appropriate. It is incumbent upon the planner to
coordinate the plan with all those who have a responsibility for
the development, management, or administration of the acquisition.
The acquisition plan should be provided to the contract administration
organization to facilitate resource allocation and planning for
the evaluation, identification, and management of contractor performance
risk.</p>

Integrated Recycling and Solid Waste Management.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(20) Other considerations.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) National Technology and Industrial
Base. For major defense acquisition programs, address the following
(10 U.S.C. 2506)—</p>
         <p class="p List6">(1) An analysis of the capabilities of
the national technology and industrial base to develop, produce,
maintain, and support such program, including consideration of the
following factors related to foreign dependency (10 U.S.C. 2505)—</p>
         <p class="p List7">(i) The availability of essential raw materials,
special alloys, composite materials, components, tooling, and production
test equipment for the sustained production of systems fully capable
of meeting the performance objectives established for those systems;
the uninterrupted maintenance and repair of such systems; and the
sustained operation of such systems.</p>
         <p class="p List7">(ii) The identification of items specified
in paragraph (b)(19)(A)(1)(i) of this section that are available
only from sources outside the national technology and industrial
base.</p>
         <p class="p List7">(iii) The availability of alternatives
for obtaining such items from within the national technology and
industrial base if such items become unavailable from sources outside
the national technology and industrial base; and an analysis of
any military vulnerability that could result from the lack of reasonable
alternatives.</p>
         <p class="p List7">(iv) The effects on the national technology
and industrial base that result from foreign acquisition of firms in
the United States.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(2) Consideration of requirements for efficient
manufacture during the design and production of the systems to be
procured under the program.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(3) The use of advanced manufacturing technology,
processes, and systems during the research and development phase
and the production phase of the program.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(4) To the maximum extent practicable,
the use of contract solicitations that encourage competing offerors
to acquire, for use in the performance of the contract, modern technology,
production equipment, and production systems (including hardware
and software) that increase the productivity of the offerors and
reduce the life-cycle costs.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(5) Methods to encourage investment by
U.S. domestic sources in advanced manufacturing technology production
equipment and processes through—</p>
         <p class="p List7">(i) Recognition of the contractor’s investment
in advanced manufacturing technology production equipment, processes,
and organization of work systems that build on workers’ skill and
experience, and work force skill development in the development
of the contract objective; and</p>
         <p class="p List7">(ii) Increased emphasis in source selection
on the efficiency of production.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(6) Expanded use of commercial manufacturing
processes rather than processes specified by DoD.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(7) Elimination of barriers to, and facilitation
of, the integrated manufacture of commercial items and items being
produced under DoD contracts.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(8) Expanded use of commercial items, commercial
items with modifications, or to the extent commercial items are
not available, nondevelopmental items (see FAR Part 10).</p>
         <p class="p List6">(9) Acquisition of major weapon systems
as commercial items (see DFARS Subpart <span class="ph PGIxref">
               <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="PGI_234.70.html#i1497249">234.70</a>
            </span>).</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) <em class="ph i">Industrial Capability (IC)</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) Provide the program’s IC strategy
that assesses the capability of the U.S. industrial base to achieve
identified surge and mobilization goals. If no IC strategy has been
developed, provide supporting rationale for this position.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) If, in the IC strategy, the
development of a detailed IC plan was determined to be applicable,
include the plan by text or by reference. If the development of
the IC plan was determined not to be applicable, summarize the details
of the analysis forming the basis of this decision.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">3</em>) If the program involves peacetime
and wartime hardware configurations that are supported by logistics support
plans, identify their impact on the IC plan.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) <em class="ph i">Special considerations for acquisition
planning for crisis situations.</em> Ensure that the requirements
of DoD Instruction 1100.22, Policy and Procedures for Determining
Workforce Mix, are addressed. Also—</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) Acquisition planning must consider
whether a contract is likely to be performed in crisis situations
outside the United States and must develop appropriately detailed
measures for inclusion in the contract. Combatant commanders establish
operational plans identifying essential services that must continue
during crisis. DoDI 1100.22 requires Combatant Commanders to develop
contingency plans if they have a reasonable doubt that a contractor
will continue to provide essential services during a mobilization
or crisis. When planning the acquisition, consider these operational
plans and the resources available to carry out these plans.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) During acquisition planning,
identify which services have been declared so essential that they
must continue during a crisis situation. A best practice is to create
a separate section, paragraph, line, or other designation in the
contract for these essential services so they can be tracked to
an option or separate contract line item.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">3</em>) The requirements for the contractor
written plan for continuity of essential services and the criteria
for assessing the sufficiency of the plan will be determined/tailored
for each acquisition of essential services by the contracting officer
in coordination with the functional manager. The contractor's written
plan, including prices/cost, shall be considered and evaluated in
conjunction with the technical evaluation of offers.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">4</em>) Operational-specific contractor
policies and requirements resulting from combatant commander “integrated
planning” will be described in operation plans (OPLAN), operation
orders (OPORD) or separate annexes, and must be incorporated into
applicable contracts. The plans may include rules for theater entry, country
clearance, use of weapons, living on-base, etc. Therefore, the requiring
activity is responsible for obtaining pertinent OPLANs, OPORDs,
and annexes (or unclassified extracts) from the affected combatant
command or military service element or component and for ensuring
that the contract is consistent with the theater OPLAN and OPORD.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">5</em>) Ask the requiring activity to
confirm that the appropriate personnel department has determined
that inherently Governmental functions are not included in the contract
requirements. If contract services will become inherently Governmental
during a time of crisis, ensure that the contract states that work
will be removed from the contract (temporarily or permanently) upon
the occurrence of a triggering event (specified in the contract)
or upon notice from the contracting officer that informs the contractor
when its responsibility to perform affected duties will stop or
restart. The contract should require the contractor to have a plan
for restarting performance after the crisis ends.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">6</em>) If the combatant commander’s
contingency plan requires military members to replace contractor
employees during a crisis or contingency, acquisition planning must
consider whether the contract should require the contractor to train
military members to do that.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">7</em>) For acquisitions that have or
may have some portion of delivery of items or performance in a foreign
country, address considerations and requirements set forth in DFARS <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="225.370.html#DFARS-225.370">225.370 Contracts requiring performance or delivery in a foreign country.</a>, Contracts requiring

considerations for contracts in support of contingency operations.</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">i</em>) When delegation of contract
administration services to a contracting officer located in a different
geographic area to support a contract for the delivery of items
or performance in a joint operations area will or may occur, address
the resourcing of contract administration and oversight personnel,
including administrative contracting officers, quality assurance
specialists, contract administrators, property administrators, and
contracting officers’ representatives.</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">ii</em>) If contract delivery of items
or performance in support of contingency operations will or may
occur in an austere, uncertain, or hostile environment, address
the need for logistics support of contract administration and oversight
personnel.</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">iii</em>) When some portion of contract
delivery of items or performance may take place in a contingency
area, address pertinent combatant commander or joint force commander
requirements and considerations for contract administration. Such
requirements will be maintained on the particular combatant commander operational
contract support website, http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pacc/cc/areas_of_responsibility.html.</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">iv</em>) When contracts are awarded
for performance in a contingency area, the head of the contracting
activity is responsible for planning to ensure that contingency
contracts will be closed in a timely manner considering personnel
turnover and preaward, contract administration, and other contracting
workload. A plan for reachback support of contract closeouts should
be included, if required.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">9</em>) For contracts that will incorporate
the clause at DFARS <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="252.225-7040.html#DFARS-252.225-7040">252.225-7040 Contractor Personnel Supporting U.S. Armed Forces Deployed Outside the United States.</a>,

         <p class="p List4">(E) <em class="ph i">Procurement Support for Theater
Security Cooperation Efforts</em>. When planning procurement support
for theater security cooperation efforts (e.g., military exercises/training,
base operations, weapons procurement, aviation fuels, construction,
or the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief projects), planners
should be aware that Department of State (DoS) missions (embassies
and consulates) do not provide such contracting support; however,
these missions can provide support for routine, non-complex services
and supplies used by U.S. Government personnel, even if funded with
foreign-military-sales case money (see DFARS PGI <span class="ph PGIxref">

            </span>).
Planners shall take the following steps:</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) Become familiar with DoS Cable
11 STATE 030953, “Procurement Roles and Responsibilities – General Services
Officer and DoD Personnel” (see also DFARS PGI <span class="ph PGIxref">

to support DoD procurement of specific theater security cooperation
procurement requirements.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">4</em>) Ascertain whether payment support
is available from the DoS mission.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">5</em>) When DoS contracting support
