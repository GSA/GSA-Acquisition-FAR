						            Without regard to the protest venue, contracting officers shall consider all protests and seek legal advice, whether protests are submitted before or after award and whether filed directly with the agency, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. (See <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="19.302.html#FAR_19_302">19.302</a> for protests of small business status, <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="19.305.html#FAR_19_305">19.305</a> for protests of disadvantaged business status, <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="19.306.html#FAR_19_306">19.306</a> for protests of HUBZone small business status, and <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="19.307.html#FAR_19_307">19.307</a> for protests of service-disabled veteran-owned small business status, and M) for protests of the status of an economically disadvantaged women-owned small business concern or of a women-owned small business concern eligible under the Women-Owned Small Business Program.)</p>

								                Require the awardee to reimburse the Government’s costs, as provided in this paragraph, where a postaward protest is sustained as the result of an awardee’s intentional or negligent misstatement, misrepresentation, or miscertification. In addition to any other remedy available, and pursuant to the requirements of <a class="xref fm:Subpart" href="Subpart_32.6.html#FAR_Subpart_32_6">subpart&nbsp; 32.6</a>, the Government may collect this debt by offsetting the amount against any payment due the awardee under any contract between the awardee and the Government.</p>

										                    When a protest is sustained by GAO under circumstances that may allow the Government to seek reimbursement for protest costs, the contracting officer will determine whether the protest was sustained based on the awardee’s negligent or intentional misrepresentation. If the protest was sustained on several issues, protest costs shall be apportioned according to the costs attributable to the awardee’s actions.</p>

										                    The contracting officer shall review the amount of the debt, degree of the awardee’s fault, and costs of collection, to determine whether a demand for reimbursement ought to be made. If it is in the best interests of the Government to seek reimbursement, the contracting officer shall notify the contractor in writing of the nature and amount of the debt, and the intention to collect by offset if necessary. Prior to issuing a final decision, the contracting officer shall afford the contractor an opportunity to inspect and copy agency records pertaining to the debt to the extent permitted by statute and regulation, and to request review of the matter by the head of the contracting activity.</p>
