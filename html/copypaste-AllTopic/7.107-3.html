						            Bundling may provide substantial benefits to the Government. However, because of the potential impact on small business participation, before conducting an acquisition strategy that involves bundling, the agency shall make a written determination that the bundling is necessary and justified in accordance with <a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title15-section644(e)&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" target="_blank">15 U.S.C. 644(e)</a>. A bundled requirement is considered necessary and justified if the agency would obtain measurably substantial benefits as compared to meeting its agency's requirements through separate smaller contracts or orders.</p>

						            The agency shall quantify the specific benefits identified through the use of market research and other techniques to explain how their impact would be measurably substantial (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="10.001.html#FAR_10_001">10.001</a>(a)(2)(iv) and (a)(3)(vii)).</p>
