         <p class="p" id="FAR_7_105__d418e8">In order to facilitate attainment of the
acquisition objectives, the plan must identify those milestones
at which decisions should be made (see paragraph (b)(21) of this
section). The plan must address all the technical, business, management,
and other significant considerations that will control the acquisition.
The specific content of plans will vary, depending on the nature,
circumstances, and stage of the acquisition. In preparing the plan,
the planner must follow the applicable instructions in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this section, together with the agency’s implementing
procedures. Acquisition plans for service contracts or orders must
describe the strategies for implementing performance-based acquisition
methods or must provide rationale for not using those methods (see <a class="xref fm:Subpart" href="Subpart_37.6.html#FAR_Subpart_37_6">subpart&nbsp; 37.6</a>).</p>
