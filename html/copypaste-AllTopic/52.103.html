						            Whenever any FAR provision or clause is used without deviation in a solicitation or contract, whether it is incorporated by reference or in full text, it shall be identified by number, title, and date. This identification shall also be used if the FAR provision or clause is used with an authorized deviation, except that the contracting officer shall then insert "(DEVIATION)" after the date. Solicited firms and contractors will be advised of the meaning of this insertion through the use of the (1) provision at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="52.252-5.html#FAR_52_252_5">52.252-5</a>, Authorized Deviations in Provisions, or (2) clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="52.252-6.html#FAR_52_252_6">52.252-6</a>, Authorized Deviations in Clauses.
