The Contractor shall notify all workers performing work on, or in
connection with, this contract of the applicable E.O. minimum wage
rate under this clause. With respect to workers covered by the Service
Contract Labor Standards statute or the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction)
statute, the Contractor may meet this requirement by posting, in
a prominent and accessible place at the worksite, the applicable
wage determination under those statutes. With respect to workers
whose wages are governed by the FLSA, the Contractor shall post
notice, utilizing the poster provided by the Administrator, which
can be obtained at 
                     <a class="xref" href="www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/government-contracts" target="_blank">www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/government-contracts</a>, in
a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Contractors that
customarily post notices to workers electronically may post the
notice electronically provided the electronic posting is displayed
prominently on any Web site that is maintained by the contractor,
whether external or internal, and customarily used for notices to
workers about terms and conditions of employment.</p>
