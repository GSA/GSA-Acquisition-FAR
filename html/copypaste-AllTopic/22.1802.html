the Social Security Administration (SSA) may terminate a contractor’s
MOU and deny access to the E-Verify system in accordance with the
terms of the MOU. If DHS or SSA terminates a contractor’s MOU, the
terminating agency must refer the contractor to a suspension or
debarment official for possible suspension or debarment action.
During the period between termination of the MOU and a decision
by the suspension or debarment official whether to suspend or debar,
the contractor is excused from its obligations under paragraph (b)
of the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="52.222-54.html#FAR_52_222_54">52.222-54</a>.
If the contractor is suspended or debarred as a result of the MOU
termination, the contractor is not eligible to participate in E-Verify
during the period of its suspension or debarment. If the suspension
or debarment official determines not to suspend or debar the contractor,
then the contractor must reenroll in E-Verify.</p>
