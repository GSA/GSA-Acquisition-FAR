         <p class="p List2">(3)  The Contractor shall—</p>

         </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  The Contracting Officer or any authorized representative shall, until 3 years after final payment under this contract, have the right to examine any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, and documents of the Contractor relating to the conception or first reduction to practice of inventions in the same field of technology as the work under this contract to determine whether—</p>

         <p class="p List3">(i)  Establish, maintain, and follow effective procedures for identifying and disclosing subject inventions pursuant to paragraph (e)(5) of this clause;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Disclose any subject invention pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this clause;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  Deliver acceptable interim reports pursuant to paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this clause; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  Provide the information regarding subcontracts pursuant to paragraph (e)(8) of this clause.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  The reserve or balance shall be withheld until the Contracting Officer has determined that the Contractor has rectified whatever deficiencies exist and has delivered all reports, disclosures, and other information required by this clause.</p>

No amount shall be withheld under this paragraph while the amount specified by this paragraph is being withheld under other provisions of the contract.
