Associate Administrator for Business Development may approve a contracting
office's request for a competitive 8(a) award below the competitive
thresholds. Such requests will be approved only on a limited basis
and will be primarily granted where technical competitions are appropriate
or where a large number of responsible 8(a) participants are available
for competition. In determining whether a request to compete below
the threshold will be approved, the SBA Associate Administrator
for Business Development will, in part, consider the extent to which
the contracting activity is supporting the 8(a) program on a noncompetitive
basis. The agency may include recommendations for competition below the
threshold in the offering letter or by separate correspondence to
the SBA Associate Administrator for Business Development.</p>
