						            If the contracting officer rejects a contractor’s request for ADR proceedings, the contracting officer shall provide the contractor a written explanation citing one or more of the conditions in <a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title5-section572(b)&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" target="_blank">5 U.S.C. 572(b)</a> or such other specific reasons that ADR procedures are inappropriate for the resolution of the dispute. In any case where a contractor rejects a request of an agency for ADR proceedings, the contractor shall inform the agency in writing of the contractor’s specific reasons for rejecting the request.</p>

						            ADR procedures may be used at any time that the contracting officer has authority to resolve the issue in controversy. If a claim has been submitted, ADR procedures may be applied to all or a portion of the claim. When ADR procedures are used subsequent to the issuance of a contracting officer’s final decision, their use does not alter any of the time limitations or procedural requirements for filing an appeal of the contracting officer’s final decision and does not constitute a reconsideration of the final decision.</p>

								                A solicitation shall not require arbitration as a condition of award, unless arbitration is otherwise required by law.
