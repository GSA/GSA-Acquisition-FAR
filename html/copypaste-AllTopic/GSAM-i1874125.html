for the costs of operating the Federal Supply Schedules Program.
FAS recoups its operating costs from ordering activities as set
forth in 40 U.S.C. 321: Acquisition Services Fund. Net operating
revenues generated by the IFF are also applied to fund initiatives
benefitting other authorized FAS programs, in accordance with 40
U.S.C. 321. Offerors must include the IFF in their prices. The fee

32.6. The Government may exercise all rights under the Debt Collection
Improvement Act of 1996, including withholding or setting off payments
