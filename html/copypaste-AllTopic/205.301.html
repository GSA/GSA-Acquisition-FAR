         <p class="p List2">(i) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2533a(k), contracting officers also must synopsize through the GPE, awards exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold that are for the acquisition of any clothing, fiber, yarn, or fabric items described in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="225.7002-1.html#DFARS-225.7002-1">225.7002-1</a>(a)(1)(ii) through (x), if -</p>
         <p class="p List3">(A) The Secretary concerned has determined that domestic items are not available, in accordance with <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="225.7002-2.html#DFARS-225.7002-2">225.7002-2</a>(b); or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(B) The acquisition is for chemical warfare protective clothing, and the contracting officer has determined that an exception to domestic source requirements applies because the acquisition furthers an agreement with a qualifying country, in accordance with <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="225.7002-2.html#DFARS-225.7002-2">225.7002-2</a>(n).</p>
