                        For sole-source procurements, SBA or the contracting officer may protest the prospective contractor's certified HUBZone status; for all other procurements, SBA, the contracting officer, or any other interested party may protest the apparent successful offeror's certified HUBZone status (see <a class="xref" href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/section-126.800" target="_blank">13 CFR 126.800</a>).

                        The Director of SBA's Office of the HUBZone Program will determine whether the concern has certified HUBZone status. If SBA upholds the protest, SBA will remove the concern's HUBZone status in the Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS). SBA's protest regulations are found in subpart H “Protests” at <a class="xref" href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/section-126.800" target="_blank">13 CFR 126.800</a> through <a class="xref" href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-13/section-126.805" target="_blank">126.805</a>.

An interested party seeking to protest both the small business size and HUBZone status of an apparent successful offeror shall file two separate protests. Protests relating to small business size status for the acquisition and the HUBZone eligibility requirements will be processed concurrently by SBA.</p>
