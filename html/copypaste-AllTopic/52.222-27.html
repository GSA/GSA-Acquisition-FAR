Contractors must be able to demonstrate participation in, and compliance with, the provisions of the plan. Each Contractor or subcontractor participating in an approved plan is also required to comply with its obligations under the Equal Opportunity clause, and to make a good faith effort to achieve each goal under the plan in each trade in which it has employees. The overall good-faith performance by other Contractors or subcontractors toward a goal in an approved plan does not excuse any Contractor’s or subcontractor’s failure to make good-faith efforts to achieve the plan’s goals.</p>

The goals stated in the solicitation for this contract are expressed as percentages of the total hours of employment and training of minority and female utilization that the Contractor should reasonably be able to achieve in each construction trade in which it has employees in the covered area. If the Contractor performs construction work in a geographical area located outside of the covered area, it shall apply the goals established for the geographical area where that work is actually performed. The Contractor is expected to make substantially uniform progress toward its goals in each craft.</p>

						            In order for the nonworking training hours of apprentices and trainees to be counted in meeting the goals, apprentices and trainees must be employed by the Contractor during the training period, and the Contractor must have made a commitment to employ the apprentices and trainees at the completion of their training, subject to the availability of employment opportunities.

If an individual was sent to the union hiring hall for referral and not referred back to the Contractor by the union or, if referred back, not employed by the Contractor, this shall be documented in the file, along with whatever additional actions the Contractor may have taken.</p>
