waiver.</em> The contracting officer may also request a waiver of
the requirements at paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (c)(2)(ii) of this section
for an individual acquisition once the contracting officer determines
through market research that no known small business manufacturers,
processors, or producers in the United States or its outlying areas
can reasonably be expected to offer an end item meeting the requirements
of the solicitation. This type of waiver is known as an individual
waiver and would apply only to a specific acquisition.</p>
