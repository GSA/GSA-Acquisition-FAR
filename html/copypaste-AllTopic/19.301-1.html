						            An offeror’s representation that it is a small business is not binding on the SBA. If an offeror’s small business status is challenged, the SBA will evaluate the status of the concern and make a determination, which will be binding on the contracting officer, as to whether the offeror is a small business. A concern cannot become eligible for a specific award by taking action to meet the definition of a small business concern after the SBA has determined that it is not a small business.</p>

If the SBA declines to take action, the agency may initiate the process. The SBA’s regulations on penalties for misrepresentations and false statements are contained in <span class="ph CFR">13 CFR 121.108</span> for small business, <span class="ph CFR">13 CFR 124.501</span> for 8(a) small business, <span class="ph CFR">13 CFR 124.1004</span> for small disadvantaged business, <span class="ph CFR">13 CFR 125.29</span> for veteran or service-disabled veteran-owned small business, <span class="ph CFR">13 CFR 126.900</span> for HUBZone small business, and <span class="ph CFR">13 CFR 127.700</span> for economically disadvantaged women-owned small business concerns and women-owned small business (WOSB) concerns eligible under the WOSB Program.</p>
