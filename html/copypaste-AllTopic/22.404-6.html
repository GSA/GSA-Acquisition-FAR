								                The Department of Labor may modify a wage determination to make it current by specifying only the items being changed or by reissuing the entire determination with changes incorporated.</p>

								                All project wage determination modifications expire on the same day as the original determination. The need to include a modification of a project wage determination for the primary site of the work in a solicitation is determined by the time of receipt of the modification by the contracting agency. Therefore, the contracting agency must annotate the modification of the project wage determination with the date and time immediately upon receipt.</p>

								                The need for	inclusion of the modification of a general wage determination for	the primary site of the work in a solicitation is determined by the	date the modified wage determination is published on the WDOL, or by	the date the agency receives actual written notice of the	modification from the Department of Labor, whichever occurs first.	(Note the distinction between receipt by the agency (modification is	effective) and receipt by the contracting officer, which may occur	later.) During the course of the solicitation, the contracting	officer shall monitor the WDOL website to determine whether the	applicable wage determination has been revised. Revisions published	on the WDOL website or otherwise communicated to the contracting	officer within the timeframes prescribed at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#FAR_22_404_6">22.404-6</a>(b) and (c) are applicable and must be included	in the resulting contract. Monitoring can be accomplished by use of	the WDOL websiteâ€™s "Alert Service".</p>

						            The following applies when contracting by sealed bidding:</p>
               
                  
                     <p class="p" id="FAR_22_404_6__d1339e40"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                        <span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span>
								                A written action modifying a wage determination shall be effective if:</p>
                     
                        
                           <p class="p" id="FAR_22_404_6__d1339e46"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

										                    It is received by the contracting agency, or is published on the WDOL, 10 or more calendar days before the date of bid opening; or</p>

										                    It is received by the contracting agency, or is published on the WDOL, less than 10 calendar days before the date of bid opening, unless the contracting officer finds that there is not reasonable time available before bid opening to notify the prospective bidders. (If the contracting officer finds that there is not reasonable time to notify bidders, a written report of the finding shall be placed in the contract file and shall be made available to the Department of Labor upon request.)</p>

								                All written actions modifying wage determinations received by the contracting agency after bid opening, or modifications to general wage determinations published on the WDOL after bid opening, shall not be effective and shall not be included in the solicitation (but see paragraph (b)(6) of this subsection).</p>

								                If an effective modification of the wage determination for the primary site of the work is received by the contracting officer before bid opening, the contracting officer shall postpone the bid opening, if necessary, to allow a reasonable time to amend the solicitation to incorporate the modification and permit bidders to amend their bids. If the modification does not change the wage rates and would not warrant amended bids, the contracting officer shall amend the solicitation to include the number and date of the modification.</p>

								                If an effective modification of the wage determination for the primary site of the work is received by the contracting officer after bid opening, but before award, the contracting officer shall follow the procedures in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="22.404-5.html#FAR_22_404_5">22.404-5</a>(b)(2)(i) or (ii).</p>

                        <span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span>
								                If an effective modification is received by the contracting officer after award, the contracting officer shall modify the contract to incorporate the wage modification retroactive to the date of award and equitably adjust the contract price for any increased or decreased cost of performance resulting from any changed wage rates. If the modification does not change any wage rates and would not warrant contract price adjustment, the contracting officer shall modify the contract to include the number and date of the modification.</p>

								                If an award is not made within 90 days after bid opening, any modification to a general wage determination which is published on the WDOL before award, shall be effective for any resultant contract unless an extension of the 90-day period is obtained from the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division. An agency head may request such an extension from the Administrator. The request must be supported by a written finding, which shall include a brief statement of factual support, that the extension is necessary and proper in the public interest to prevent injustice, undue hardship, or to avoid serious impairment in the conduct of Government business. The contracting officer shall follow the procedures in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="22.404-5.html#FAR_22_404_5">22.404-5</a>(b)(2).</p>
