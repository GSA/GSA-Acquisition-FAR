wage determination modifications expire on the same day as the original
determination. The need to include a modification of a project wage
determination for the primary site of the work in a solicitation
is determined by the time of receipt of the modification by the
contracting agency. Therefore, the contracting agency must annotate the
modification of the project wage determination with the date and
time immediately upon receipt.</p>

by the date the modified wage determination is published on the Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em>

or by the date the agency receives actual written notice of the
modification from the Department of Labor, whichever occurs first.
(Note the distinction between receipt by the agency (modification
is effective) and receipt by the contracting officer, which may
occur later.) During the course of the solicitation, the contracting
officer shall monitor the Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em>
                         website
to determine whether the applicable wage determination has been revised.

or otherwise communicated to the contracting officer within the
timeframes prescribed at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#FAR_22_404_6">22.404-6</a>(b) and (c) are
