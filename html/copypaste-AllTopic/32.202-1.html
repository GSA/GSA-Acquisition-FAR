                  <em class="ph i">Use of financing in contracts.</em> It is the responsibility of the contractor to provide all resources needed for performance of the contract. Thus, for purchases of commercial items, financing of the contract is normally the contractor’s responsibility. However, in some markets the provision of financing by the buyer is a commercial practice. In these circumstances, the contracting officer may include appropriate financing terms in contracts for commercial purchases when doing so will be in the best interest of the Government.</p>

                  <em class="ph i">Difference from non-commercial financing.</em> Government financing of commercial purchases under this subpart is expected to be different from that used for non-commercial purchases under <a class="xref fm:Subpart" href="Subpart_32.1.html#FAR_Subpart_32_1">subpart&nbsp; 32.1</a> and its related subparts. While the contracting officer may adapt techniques and procedures from the non-commercial subparts for use in implementing commercial contract financing arrangements, the contracting officer must have a full understanding of effects of the differing contract environments and of what is needed to protect the interests of the Government in commercial contract financing.</p>

Agencies may establish standards to determine whether contract financing is in the best interest of the Government. These standards may be for certain types of procurements, certain types of items, or certain dollar levels of procurements.</p>
