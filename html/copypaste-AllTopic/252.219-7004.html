         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Provide its contract number, its unique entity identifier, and the email address of the Contractor’s official responsible for acknowledging or rejecting the ISR to all first-tier subcontractors, who will be required to submit ISRs, so they can enter this information into the eSRS when submitting their reports.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(1)  To determine the need for liquidated damages, the Contracting Officer will conduct a compliance review during the fiscal year after the close of the fiscal year for which the plan is applicable.  The Contracting Officer will compare the approved percentage or dollar goals to the total, actual subcontracting dollars covered by the plan.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  If the Contractor has failed to meet its approved subcontracting goal(s), the Contracting Officer will provide the Contractor written notice specifying the failure, advising of the potential for assessment of liquidated damages, and permitting the Contractor to demonstrate what good faith efforts have been made.  The Contracting Officer may take the Contractor’s failure to respond to the notice within 15 working days (or longer period at the Contracting Officer’s discretion) as an admission that no valid explanation exists.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  If, after consideration of all relevant information, the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with the comprehensive subcontracting plan, the Contracting Officer will issue a final decision to the Contractor to that effect and require the Contractor to pay liquidated damages to the Government in the amount identified in the comprehensive subcontracting plan.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4)  The Contractor shall have the right of appeal under the clause in this contract entitled “Disputes” from any final decision of the Contracting Officer.</p>
