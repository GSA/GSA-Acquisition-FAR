Workability is generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state of the art. To be considered “developed,” the item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code;</p>

The Contracting Officer reserves the right to add the Contractor's assertions to the Attachment and validate any listed assertions, at a later date, in accordance with the procedures of the Validation of Asserted Restrictions - Computer Software and/or Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clauses of this contract.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) <em class="ph i">Marking requirements.</em> The Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software to be delivered under this contract by marking the deliverable data or software subject to restriction. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this clause, only the following markings are authorized under this contract: the limited rights legend at paragraph (f)(2) of this clause; the restricted rights legend at paragraph (f)(3) of this clause, the SBIR data rights legend at paragraph (f)(4) of this clause, or the special license rights legend at paragraphs (f)(5) of this clause; and/or a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">General marking instructions.</em> The Contractor, or its subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the appropriate legend to all technical data and computer software that qualify for such markings. The authorized legends shall be placed on the transmittal document or storage container and, for printed material, each page of the printed material containing technical data or computer software for which restrictions are asserted. When only portions of a page of printed material are subject to the asserted restrictions, such portions shall be identified by circling, underscoring, with a note, or other appropriate identifier. Technical data or computer software transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to another shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions. However, instructions that interfere with or delay the operation of computer software in order to display a restrictive rights legend or other license statement at any time prior to or during use of the computer software, or otherwise cause such interference or delay, shall not be inserted in software that will or might be used in combat or situations that simulate combat conditions, unless the Contracting Officer's written permission to deliver such software has been obtained prior to delivery. Reproductions of technical data, computer software, or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Limited rights markings.</em> Technical data not generated under this contract that pertain to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense and delivered or otherwise furnished with limited rights shall be marked with the following legend:</p>

         <p class="p">The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose these technical data are restricted by paragraph (b)(2) of the Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and Computer Software - Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program clause contained in the above identified contract. Any reproduction of technical data or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings. Any person, other than the Government, who has been provided access to such data must promptly notify the above named Contractor.</p>

         <p class="p">Contractor Address</p>
         <p class="p"></p>
         <p class="p">The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose this software are restricted by paragraph (b)(3) of the Rights in Noncommercial Technical Data and Computer Software - Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program clause contained in the above identified contract. Any reproduction of computer software or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings.

         <p class="p">(4) <em class="ph i">SBIR data rights markings:</em> Except for technical data or computer software in which the Government has acquired unlimited rights under paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, or negotiated special license rights as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this clause, technical data or computer software generated under this contract shall be marked with the following legend. The Contractor shall enter the expiration date for the SBIR data rights period on the legend:</p>

Any reproduction of technical data, computer software, or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings.</p>
         <p class="p">(End of legend)</p>
         <p class="p">(ii) For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see paragraph (b)(6) of this clause).</p>
         <p class="p">(6) <em class="ph i">Pre-existing data markings.</em> If the terms of a prior contract or license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software, and those restrictions are still applicable, the Contractor may mark such data or software with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the data or software qualified under the prior contract or license. The marking procedures in paragraph (f)(1) of this clause shall be followed.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) <em class="ph i">Contractor procedures and records.</em> Throughout performance of this contract, the Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver technical data or computer software with other than unlimited rights, shall -</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the terms of this clause; and</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any restrictive markings on technical data or computer software delivered under this contract.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(h) <em class="ph i">Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings</em> - (1) <em class="ph i">Unjustified markings.</em> The rights and obligations of the parties regarding the validation of restrictive markings on technical data or computer software furnished or to be furnished under this contract are contained in the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data and the Validation of Asserted Restrictions - Computer Software clauses of this contract, respectively. Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with the applicable procedures of those clauses, a restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Nonconforming markings.</em> A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on technical data or computer software delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in the format authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming markings is not subject to the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data or the Validation of Asserted Restrictions - Computer Software clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of a nonconforming marking or markings and the Contractor fails to remove or correct such markings within sixty (6)) days, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct any nonconforming markings.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(i) <em class="ph i">Relation to patents.</em> Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to the Government under any patent.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(j) <em class="ph i">Limitation on charges for rights in technical data or computer software.</em> (1) The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including but not limited to, license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights in technical data or computer software to be delivered under this contract when -</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater rights in the data or software; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The data are available to the public without restrictions.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause -</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor of supplier technical data or computer software, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the documents or other media in which the technical data or computer software will be delivered.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(k) <em class="ph i">Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers.</em> (1) the Contractor shall assure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers under 10 U.S.C. 2320, 10 U.S.C. 2321, and the identification, assertion, and delivery processes required by paragraph (e) of this clause are recognized and protected.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Whenever any noncommercial technical data or computer software is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The Contractor shall use the Technical Data - Commercial Items clause of this contract to obtain technical data pertaining to commercial items, components, or processes. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's technical data or computer software.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for technical data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such technical data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data or computer software from their subcontractors or suppliers.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data or computer software as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.</p>

Any such publication(s) shall include a notice identifying the number of this contract and the Government's rights in the published data.</p>
