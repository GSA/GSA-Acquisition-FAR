         <p class="p List1">(a)  Mitigation is any action taken to minimize an organizational conflict of interest.  Mitigation may require Government action, contractor action, or a combination of both.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b)  If the contracting officer and the contractor have agreed to mitigation of an organizational conflict of interest, a Government-approved Organizational Conflict of Interest Mitigation Plan, reflecting the actions a contractor has agreed to take to mitigate a conflict, shall be incorporated into the contract.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c)  If the contracting officer determines, after consultation with agency legal counsel, that the otherwise successful offeror is unable to effectively mitigate an organizational conflict of interest, then the contracting officer, taking into account both the instant contract and longer term Government needs, shall use another approach to resolve the organizational conflict of interest, select another offeror, or request a waiver in accordance with <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 9.503</span> (but see statutory prohibition in <span class="ph DFARxref">
