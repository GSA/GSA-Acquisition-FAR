                  <em class="ph i">Ability to obtain resources</em>.
Except to the extent that a prospective contractor has sufficient
resources or proposes to perform the contract by subcontracting,
the contracting officer shall require acceptable evidence of the
prospective contractor’s ability to obtain required resources (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="9.104-1.html#FAR_9_104_1">9.104-1</a>(a), (e), and (f)).
Acceptable evidence normally consists of a commitment or explicit
arrangement, that will be in existence at the time of contract award,
to rent, purchase, or otherwise acquire the needed facilities, equipment,
other resources, or personnel. Consideration of a prime contractor’s
compliance with limitations on subcontracting shall take into account
the time period covered by the contract base period or quantities plus
option periods or quantities, if such options are considered when
evaluating offers for award.</p>
            
            
               <p class="p" id="FAR_9_104_3__d547e20"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span>
                  <em class="ph i">Satisfactory
performance record</em>. A prospective contractor that is or recently
has been seriously deficient in contract performance shall be presumed
to be nonresponsible, unless the contracting officer determines
that the circumstances were properly beyond the contractor’s control,
or that the contractor has taken appropriate corrective action.
Past failure to apply sufficient tenacity and perseverance to perform
acceptably is strong evidence of nonresponsibility. Failure to meet
the quality requirements of the contract is a significant factor
to consider in determining satisfactory performance. The contracting officer
shall consider the number of contracts involved and the extent of
deficient performance in each contract when making this determination.
If the pending contract requires a subcontracting plan pursuant
to <a class="xref fm:Subpart" href="Subpart_19.7.html#FAR_Subpart_19_7">subpart&nbsp; 19.7</a>, The
Small Business Subcontracting Program, the contracting officer shall
also consider the prospective contractor’s compliance with subcontracting
plans under recent contracts.</p>

                  <em class="ph i">Affiliated
concerns</em>. Affiliated concerns (see "Concern" in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="19.001.html#FAR_19_001">19.001</a> and "Small business
concern" in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="2.101.html#FAR_2_101">2.101</a> ) are normally considered
separate entities in determining whether the concern that is to
perform the contract meets the applicable standards for responsibility.
However, the contracting officer shall consider the affiliate’s
past performance and integrity when they may adversely affect the
prospective contractor’s responsibility.</p>
