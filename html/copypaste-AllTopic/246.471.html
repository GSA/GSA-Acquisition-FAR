         <p class="p List2">(1)  Ordinarily, a representative of the contract administration office signs or stamps the shipping papers that accompany Government source-inspected supplies to release them for shipment.  This is done for both prime and subcontracts.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  An alternative procedure (see paragraph (b) of this section) permits the contractor to assume the responsibility for releasing the supplies for shipment.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  The alternative procedure may include prime contractor release of supplies inspected at a subcontractor's facility.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4)  The use of the alternative procedure releases DoD manpower to perform technical functions by eliminating routine signing or stamping of the papers accompanying each shipment.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(i)  The stamping or signing of the shipping papers by a representative of the contract administration office interferes with the operation of the Government contract quality assurance program or takes too much of the Government representative's time;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  There is sufficient continuity of production to permit the Government to establish a systematic and continuing evaluation of the contractor's control of quality; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  The contractor has a record of satisfactory quality, including that pertaining to preparation for shipment.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  The contract administration office shall withdraw, in writing, the authorization when there is an indication that the conditions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section no longer exist. </p>
         <p class="p List2">(4)  When the alternative procedure is used, require the contractor to—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  Type or stamp, and sign, the following statement on the required copy or copies of the shipping paper(s), or on an attachment—</p>
