						             A commercial plan (as defined in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="19.701.html#FAR_19_701">19.701</a>) is the preferred type of subcontracting plan for contractors furnishing commercial items. Once a contractorâ€™s commercial plan has been approved, the Government shall not require another subcontracting plan from the same contractor while the plan remains in effect, as long as the product or service being provided by the contractor continues to meet the definition of a commercial item.
