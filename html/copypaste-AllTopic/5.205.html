Contracting officers may transmit to the GPE	advance notices of their interest in potential R&amp;D programs	whenever market research does not produce a sufficient number of	concerns to obtain adequate competition. Advance notices must not	be used where security considerations prohibit such publication. Advance	notices will enable potential sources to learn of R&amp;D programs	and provide these sources with an opportunity to submit information	which will permit evaluation of their capabilities. Contracting	officers must consider potential sources which respond to advance	notices for a subsequent solicitation. Advanced notices must be	entitled "Research and Development Sources Sought" and include the	name and telephone number of the contracting officer or other contracting activity	official from whom technical details of the project can be obtained.	This will enable sources to submit information for evaluation of	their R&amp;D capabilities. Contracting officers must synopsize	(see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="5.201.html#FAR_5_201">5.201</a>) all subsequent	solicitations for R&amp;D contracts, including those resulting from	a previously synopsized advance notice, unless one of the exceptions	in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="5.202.html#FAR_5_202">5.202</a> applies.</p>
