         <p class="p List3">(iii)  The proposed technical approaches will require no, or minimal, subjective judgment by the source selection authority as to the desirability of one offeror’s proposal versus a competing proposal; </p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  The source selection authority has a high degree of confidence that reviewing the technical proposals of all offerors would not result in the identification of characteristics that could provide value or benefit; </p>

         <p class="p List3">(vi)  Goods to be procured are predominantly expendable in nature, are nontechnical, or have a short life expectancy or short shelf life (See <span class="ph PGIxref">PGI 215.101-2-70</span>(a)(1)(vi) for assistance with evaluating whether a requirement satisfies this limitation); </p>
         <p class="p List3">(vii)  The contract file contains a determination that the lowest price reflects full life-cycle costs (as defined at <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 7.101</span>) of the product(s) or service(s) being acquired (see <span class="ph PGIxref">PGI 215.101-2-70</span>(a)(1)(vii) for information on obtaining this determination); and</p>

         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Items designated by the requiring activity as personal protective equipment (except see paragraph (b)(1) of this section); or</p>
