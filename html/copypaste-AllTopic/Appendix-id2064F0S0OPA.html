         <p class="p List2">(3) An increase in the employment level of protege firms from the date of entry into the Program until 2 years after the completion of the agreement.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) This policy sets forth the procedures for participation in the Program applicable to companies that are interested in receiving—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Reimbursement through a separate contract line item in a DoD contract or a separate contract with DoD; or</p>
