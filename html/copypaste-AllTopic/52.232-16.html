on undefinitized contract actions</em>. Notwithstanding any other
progress payment provisions in this contract, progress payments
may not exceed 80 percent of costs incurred on work accomplished
under undefinitized contract actions. A "contract action" is any
action resulting in a contract, as defined in <a class="xref fm:Subpart" href="Subpart_2.1.html#FAR_Subpart_2_1">subpart&nbsp; 2.1</a>, including
contract modifications for additional supplies or services, but
not including contract modifications that are within the scope and
under the terms of the contract, such as contract modifications
issued pursuant to the Changes clause, or funding and other administrative changes.
This limitation shall apply to the costs incurred, as computed in
accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, and shall remain in
effect until the contract action is definitized. Costs incurred
which are subject to this limitation shall be segregated on Contractor
progress payment requests and invoices from those costs eligible
for higher progress payment rates. For purposes of progress payment
liquidation, as described in paragraph (b) of this clause, progress
payments for undefinitized contract actions shall be liquidated
at 80 percent of the amount invoiced for work performed under the
undefinitized contract action as long as the contract action remains
undefinitized. The amount of unliquidated progress payments for
undefinitized contract actions shall not exceed 80 percent of the
maximum liability of the Government under the undefinitized contract
action or such lower limit specified elsewhere in the contract.
Separate limits may be specified for separate actions.</p>
