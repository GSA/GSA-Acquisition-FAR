Major end items include aircraft; ships; boats; motorized wheeled, tracked, and towed vehicles for use on highway or rough terrain; weapon and missile end items; ammunition; and sets, assemblies, or end items having a major end item as a component.	</p>
         <p class="p">“Unique item identifier (UII)” means a set of data elements permanently marked on an item that is globally unique and unambiguous and never changes in order to provide traceability of the item throughout its total life cycle.
