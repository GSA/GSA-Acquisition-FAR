                  <span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> If the contracting officer has
determined that an exception applies because the cost of certain
domestic construction material is unreasonable, in accordance with
section <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="25.604.html#FAR_25_604">25.604</a>, then the contracting
officer shall apply evaluation factors to the offer incorporating
the use of such foreign construction material as follows:</p>
               
                  
                     <p class=" ListL2" id="FAR_25_605__d1669e19">
                        <span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Use
an evaluation factor of 25 percent, applied to the total offered
price of the contract, if foreign manufactured construction material
is incorporated in the offer based on an exception for unreasonable
cost of comparable domestic construction material requested by the
offeror.</p>
                  
                  
                     <p class=" ListL2" id="FAR_25_605__d1669e24">
                        <span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> In addition,
use an evaluation factor of 20
percent applied to the cost of foreign unmanufactured construction
material incorporated in the offer based on an exception for unreasonable
cost of comparable domestic unmanufactured construction material
requested by the offeror.</p>
                  
                  
                     <p class=" ListL2" id="FAR_25_605__d1669e29">

price = offered price + (.25 x offered price, if (a)(1) applies)

unmanufactured construction material, if (a)(2) applies).</p>

                  <span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> If the
solicitation specifies award on the basis of factors in addition
to cost or price, apply the evaluation factors as specified in paragraph
(a) of this section and use the evaluated price in determining the
offer that represents the best value to the Government</p>

                  <span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Unless
paragraph (b) applies, if two or more offers are equal in price,
the contracting officer must give preference to an offer that does
not include foreign construction material excepted at the request
of the offeror on the basis of unreasonable cost.</p>

                  <span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> Offerors
also may submit alternate offers based on use of equivalent domestic
construction material to avoid possible rejection of the entire
offer if the Government determines that an exception permitting
use of a particular foreign construction material does not apply.</p>

contracting officer awards a contract to an offeror that proposed
foreign construction material not listed in the applicable clause
in the solicitation (paragraph (b)(3) of <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="52.225-21.html#FAR_52_225_21">52.225-21</a>, or paragraph
(b)(3) of <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="52.225-23.html#FAR_52_225_23">52.225-23</a>), the contracting
officer must add the excepted materials to the list in the contract
clause.</p>
