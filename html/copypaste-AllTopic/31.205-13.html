								                The allowability of food and dormitory losses are determined by the following factors:</p>
                     
                        
                           <p class="p" id="FAR_31_205_13__d1968e76"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

										                    Losses from operating food and dormitory services are allowable only if the contractor’s objective is to operate such services on a break-even basis.</p>

										                    Losses sustained because food services or lodging accommodations are furnished without charge or at prices or rates which obviously would not be conducive to the accomplishment of the objective in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this subsection are not allowable, except as described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this subsection.</p>

										                    A loss may be allowed to the extent that the contractor can demonstrate that unusual circumstances exist such that even with efficient management, operating the services on a break-even basis would require charging inordinately high prices, or prices or rates higher than those charged by commercial establishments offering the same services in the same geographical areas.

						            When the contractor has an arrangement authorizing an employee association to provide or operate a service, such as vending machines in the contractor’s plant, and retain the profits, such profits shall be treated in the same manner as if the contractor were providing the service (but see paragraph (f) of this subsection).</p>
