								                The allowability of food and dormitory losses are determined by the following factors:</p>
                     
                        
                           <p class=" ListL3" id="FAR_31_205_13__d1968e76">
                              <span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span>
										                    Losses from operating food and dormitory services are allowable only if the contractor’s objective is to operate such services on a break-even basis.</p>
                        
                        
                           <p class=" ListL3" id="FAR_31_205_13__d1968e81">
                              <span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span>
										                    Losses sustained because food services or lodging accommodations are furnished without charge or at prices or rates which obviously would not be conducive to the accomplishment of the objective in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this subsection are not allowable, except as described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this subsection.</p>

                              <span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span>
										                    A loss may be allowed to the extent that the contractor can demonstrate that unusual circumstances exist such that even with efficient management, operating the services on a break-even basis would require charging inordinately high prices, or prices or rates higher than those charged by commercial establishments offering the same services in the same geographical areas. The following are examples of unusual circumstances:</p>

												                        The contractor must provide food or dormitory services at remote locations where adequate commercial facilities are not reasonably available.</p>

                                    <span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span>
												                        The contractor’s charged (but unproductive) labor costs would be excessive if the services were not available.</p>

												                        If cessation or reduction of food or dormitory operations will not otherwise yield net cost savings.</p>

                        <span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>
								                Costs of food and dormitory services shall include an allocable share of indirect expenses pertaining to these activities.</p>

                  <span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span>
						            When the contractor has an arrangement authorizing an employee association to provide or operate a service, such as vending machines in the contractor’s plant, and retain the profits, such profits shall be treated in the same manner as if the contractor were providing the service (but see paragraph (f) of this subsection).</p>
            
            
               <p class=" ListL1" id="FAR_31_205_13__d1968e117">
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span>
						            Contributions by the contractor to an employee organization, including funds from vending machine receipts or similar sources, are allowable only to the extent that the contractor demonstrates that an equivalent amount of the costs incurred by the employee organization would be allowable if directly incurred by the contractor..</p>
