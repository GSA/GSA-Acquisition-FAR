            </span>, Rights in Special Works, in solicitations and contracts where the Government has a specific need to control the distribution of works first produced, created, or generated in the performance of a contract and required to be delivered under that contract, including controlling distribution by obtaining an assignment of copyright, or a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities that may arise out of the creation, delivery, use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of such works.  Use the clause—</p>

            </span> when the Government must own or control copyright in a portion of a work first produced, created, or generated and required to be delivered under a contract.  The specific portion in which the Government must own or control copyright must be identified in a special contract requirement.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b)  Although the Government obtains an assignment of copyright and unlimited rights in a special work under the clause at <span class="ph DFARxref">
               <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="252.227-7020.html#DFARS-252.227-7020">252.227-7020</a>
            </span>, the contractor retains use and disclosure rights in that work.  If the Government needs to restrict a contractor's rights to use or disclose a special work, it must also negotiate a special license which specifically restricts the contractor's use or disclosure rights.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c)  The clause at <span class="ph DFARxref">
               <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="252.227-7020.html#DFARS-252.227-7020">252.227-7020</a>

Grant permission only when the Government's requirements cannot be satisfied unless the third party work is included in the deliverable work.</p>
