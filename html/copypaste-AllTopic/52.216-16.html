As used in the Federal, State, and Local Taxes clause or in any
other clause that provides for certain taxes or duties to be included
in, or excluded from, the contract price, the term "contract price"
includes the total target price or, if it has been established,
the total final price. When any of these clauses requires that the
contract price be increased or decreased as a result of changes
in the obligation of the Contractor to pay or bear the burden of
certain taxes or duties, the increase or decrease shall be made
in the total target price or, if it has been established, in the
total final price, so that it will not affect the Contractor’s profit
or loss on this contract.</p>
