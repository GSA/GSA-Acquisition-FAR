The transmittal letter shall advise the contractor that the determination is a final decision from which the contractor may appeal under the Disputes clause, except as shown in paragraph (f) of this section. The determination shall specify the amount due the contractor and will be supported by detailed schedules conforming generally to the forms for settlement proposals prescribed in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="49.602-1.html#FAR_49_602_1">49.602-1</a> and by additional information, schedules, and analyses as appropriate.

The pendency of an appeal shall not affect the authority of the TCO to settle the settlement proposal or any part by negotiation with the contractor at any time before the appeal is decided.</p>
