Offerors: “GSA provides this model plan as a tool. The contracting
officer must adapt this model plan to fit the subcontracting situation.
The plan is NOT a fill-in-the-blank form and the contracting officer
must remove instructional language. This model does not establish
minimum requirements for an acceptable plan. The model reflects
objectives GSA encourages contractors to adopt. GSA expects offerors
to thoroughly review the requirements set forth in FAR 19.704, Subcontracting
Plan Requirements and FAR Clause 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting
Plan before submitting their subcontracting plans.”</p>

                         &nbsp;Remember that a positive
goal is required to establish a gauge for measuring results and
to provide an incentive for continuing efforts to increase the dollar
value of subcontracts placed with small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged,
women-owned small, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned
small business concerns. Carefully scrutinize any subcontracting
category (e.g., small business, HUBZone small business, etc.) where
the offeror does not specify a goal and accept it only after assuring
that no subcontracting opportunities exist. If any category with
no goal is accepted, the contracting officer must:</p>

                               &nbsp;Ensure
the subcontracting plan includes an assurance that the contractor
will make every effort to continue seeking subcontracting opportunities
in the category that lacks a goal.</p>

                   &nbsp;A
contracting officer cannot tell the offeror what its goals must
be. The contracting officer may tell the offeror what GSA’s national
goals are. Ensure that an offeror’s subcontracting plan reflects
realistic goals and provides the maximum opportunity practicable
to small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned small,
veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business
concerns to participate as subcontractors. If necessary, obtain
information from the offeror to substantiate the offeror’s proposed
goals, past performance with respect to subcontracting, and the
proposed good faith effort. This information may include the names
of proposed subcontractors and other such data.</p>

                   &nbsp;When
a contracting officer receives a subcontracting plan with initial
offers, provide an opportunity for the SBTA to review the subcontracting
plans of those offers in the competitive range. Allow the SBTA 5
workdays for review. Consider the SBTA’s comments in developing
a negotiation strategy.</p>

whenever possible, offer recommendations for subcontracting potential
