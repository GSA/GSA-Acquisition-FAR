						            Acquisition planning should begin	as soon as the agency need is identified, preferably well in advance	of the fiscal year in which contract award or order placement is	necessary. In developing the plan, the planner shall form a team	consisting of all those who will be responsible for significant	aspects of the acquisition, such as contracting, small business, fiscal,	legal, and technical personnel. If contract performance is to be	in a designated operational area or supporting a diplomatic or consular	mission, the planner shall also consider inclusion of the combatant	commander or chief of mission, as appropriate. The planner should	review previous plans for similar acquisitions and discuss them	with the key personnel involved in those acquisitions. At key dates	specified in the plan or whenever significant changes occur, and	no less often than annually, the planner shall review the plan and,	if appropriate, revise it.</p>

						            Requirements	and logistics personnel should avoid issuing requirements on an	urgent basis or with unrealistic delivery or performance schedules,	since it generally restricts competition and increases prices. Early	in the planning process, the planner should consult with requirements	and logistics personnel who determine type, quality, quantity, and	delivery requirements.</p>
