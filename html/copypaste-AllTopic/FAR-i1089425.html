When using the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1052807.html#i1052807">52.227-21</a>, the section of the contract specifying data delivery requirements (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1089394.html#i1089394">27.406-1</a>(b)) shall expressly identify those line items of technical data to which the clause applies. Upon delivery of the technical data, the contracting officer shall review the technical data and the contractorâ€™s declaration relating to it to assure that the data are complete, accurate, and comply with contract requirements. If the data are not complete, accurate, or compliant, the contracting officer should request the contractor to correct the deficiencies, and may withhold payment. Final payment shall not be made under the contract until it has been determined that the delivery requirements of those line items of data to which the clause applies have been satisfactorily met.</p>

                        The contracting officer shall require the delivery of any technical data relating to the major system or supplies for the major system, that are to be developed exclusively with Federal funds if the delivery of the technical data is needed to ensure the competitive acquisition of supplies or services that will be required in substantial quantities in the future.
