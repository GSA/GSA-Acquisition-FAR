         <p class="p List3">(i) Frequently, foreign carriers are owned
by the government of the country in which they operate. The foreign
governments often prescribe the methods of doing business.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) In contracts for telecommunications
services in foreign countries, describe the rates and practices
in as much detail as possible. It is DoD policy not to pay discriminatory
rates. DoD will pay a reasonable rate for telecommunications services
or the rate charged the military of that country, whichever is less.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Refer special problems with telecommunications
acquisition in foreign countries to higher headquarters for resolution
with appropriate State Department representatives.</p>
