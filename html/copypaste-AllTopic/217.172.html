         <p class="p List3">(iii) The system being acquired pursuant to such contract has not been determined to have experienced cost growth in excess of the critical cost growth threshold pursuant to 10 USC 2433(d) within 5 years prior to the date the Secretary anticipates such contract (or a contract for advance procurement entered into consistent with the authorization for such contract) will be awarded (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(C)).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) A sufficient number of end items of the system being acquired under such contract have been delivered at or within the most current estimates of the program acquisition unit cost or procurement unit cost for such system to determine that current estimates of such unit costs are realistic (10 U.S.C.2306b(i)(3)(D)).</p>

         <p class="p List3">(vii) The proposed multiyear contract provides for production at not less than minimum economic rates, given the existing tooling and facilities (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(3)(G)). The head of the agency shall submit to OUSD(C)(P/B) information supporting the agency’s determination that this requirement has been met.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(viii) The head of the agency shall submit information supporting this certification to OUSD(C)(P/B) for transmission to Congress through the Secretary of Defense.</p>

         <p class="p List6">
            <em class="ph i">(1)</em> The cancellation ceiling amounts planned for each program year in the proposed multiyear contract, together with the reasons for the amounts planned;</p>
         <p class="p List6">
            <em class="ph i">(2)</em> The extent to which costs of contract cancellation are not included in the budget for the contract; and</p>

         <p class="p List2">(5) The Secretary may make the certification under paragraph (h)(2) of this section notwithstanding the fact that one or more of the conditions of such certification are not met if the Secretary determines that, due to exceptional circumstances, proceeding with a multiyear contract under this section is in the best interest of the Department of Defense and the Secretary provides the basis for such determination with the certification (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(6)).</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) The Secretary of Defense may not delegate this authority to make the certification under paragraph (h)(2) of this section or the determination under paragraph (h)(5) of this section to an official below the level of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (10 U.S.C. 2306b(i)(7)).</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) All other requirements of law are met and there are no other statutory restrictions on using a multiyear contract for the specific system or component.
