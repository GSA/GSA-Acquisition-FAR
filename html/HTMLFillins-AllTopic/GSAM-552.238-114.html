                        &nbsp;When
the Contractor accepts an order from such an entity, a separate
contract is formed which incorporates by reference all the terms
and conditions of the Schedule contract except the Disputes clause,
the patent indemnity clause, and the portion of the Commercial Item
Contract Terms and Conditions that specifies “Compliance with laws
unique to Government contracts” (which applies only to contracts
with entities of the Executive branch of the U.S. Government). The
parties to this new contract which incorporates the terms and conditions
of the Schedule contract are the individual ordering activity and
the Contractor. The U.S. Government shall not be liable for the
performance or nonperformance of the new contract. Disputes which
cannot be resolved by the parties to the new contract may be litigated in
any State or Federal court with jurisdiction over the parties, applying
Federal procurement law, including statutes, regulations and case
law, and, if pertinent, the Uniform Commercial Code. To the extent
authorized by law, parties to this new contract are encouraged to
resolve disputes through Alternative Dispute Resolution. Likewise,
a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA), although not a contract, is
an agreement that may be entered into by the Contractor with such an
entity and the Federal Government is not a party.</p>

(a)(1) of this clause. Ordering activities may include terms and
conditions required by statute, ordinance, regulation, order, or
as otherwise allowed by State and local government entities as a
part of a statement of work (SOW) or statement of objective (SOO) to
the extent that these terms and conditions do not conflict with
the terms and conditions of the Schedule contract. The ordering
activity and the Contractor expressly acknowledge that, in entering
into an agreement for the ordering activity to purchase goods or
services from the Contractor, neither the ordering activity nor
the Contractor will look to, primarily or in any secondary capacity,
or file any claim against the United States or any of its agencies
with respect to any failure of performance by the other party.</p>
