						            Concurrent with the transmittal of each statement of work or any modification to a statement of work for a service contract, the requirements office must provide the contracting officer a written determination that none of the functions to be performed are inherently governmental as defined in FAR 7.5. The determination must include a statement that the requirement is not for functions similar to those listed under FAR 7.503(c).</p>

						            The requirements office must also review the examples of functions listed under paragraph (d) of FAR 7.503. While these functions are not inherently governmental, they may restrict the discretionary authority, decision-making responsibility, or accountability of Government officials using the contractor services or work products. If the services to be acquired may cause such restrictions, the acquisition plan must discuss the associated vulnerabilities, and address management controls to mitigate them.</p>
