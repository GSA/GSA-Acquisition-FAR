If the contracting officer receives no acceptable offers from HUBZone small business concerns, the HUBZone set-aside shall be withdrawn and the requirement, if still valid, set aside for small business concerns, as appropriate (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1101696.html#i1101696">19.203</a>).</p>
