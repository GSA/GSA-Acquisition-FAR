If the contracting officer learns that a financial institution's rating has dropped below investment grade level, the contracting officer shall give the contractor 30 days to substitute an acceptable ILC or shall draw on the ILC using the sight draft in paragraph (g) of the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1051290.html#i1051290">52.228-14</a>.</p>
