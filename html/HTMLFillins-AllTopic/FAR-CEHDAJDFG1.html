                  Bundling may provide substantial benefits to the Government. However, because of the potential impact on small business participation, before conducting an acquisition strategy that involves bundling, the agency shall make a written determination that the bundling is necessary and justified in accordance with <a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml;jsessionid=114A3287C7B3359E597506A31FC855B3" target="_blank">15 U.S.C. 644(e)</a>. A bundled requirement is considered necessary and justified if the agency would obtain measurably substantial benefits as compared to meeting its agency's requirements through separate smaller contracts or orders.</p>

                  The agency shall quantify the specific benefits identified through the use of market research and other techniques to explain how their impact would be measurably substantial (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1114676.html#i1114676">10.001</a>(a)(2)(iv) and (a)(3)(vii)).</p>
