                  <span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> This solicitation sets forth the Government’s known delivery requirements for data (as defined in the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1052520.html#i1052520">52.227-14</a>, Rights in Data-General). Any resulting contract may also provide the Government the option to order additional data under the Additional Data Requirements clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1052670.html#i1052670">52.227-16</a>, if included in the contract. Any data delivered under the resulting contract will be subject to the Rights in Data-General clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1052520.html#i1052520">52.227-14</a> included in this contract. Under the latter clause, a Contractor may withhold from delivery data that qualify as limited rights data or restricted computer software, and deliver form, fit, and function data instead. The latter clause also may be used with its Alternates II and/or III to obtain delivery of limited rights data or restricted computer software, marked with limited rights or restricted rights notices, as appropriate. In addition, use of Alternate V with this latter clause provides the Government the right to inspect such data at the Contractor’s facility.</p>
