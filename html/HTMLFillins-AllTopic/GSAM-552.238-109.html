Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), “Policy for a Common
Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors” establishes
the requirement for a mandatory Government-wide standard for secure and
reliable forms of identification issued by the Federal Government
to its employees and Contractor employees assigned to Government
contracts in order to enhance security, increase Government efficiency,
reduce identity fraud, and protect personal privacy. Further, the
Directive requires the Department of Commerce to promulgate a Federal
standard for secure and reliable forms of identification within
six months of the date of the Directive. As a result, the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released Federal Information
Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-2: Personal Identity Verification
of Federal Employees and Contractors August 2013. FIPS 201-2 requires
that the digital certificates incorporated into the Personal Identity
Verification (PIV) identity credentials comply with the X.509 Certificate
Policy for the U.S. Federal PKI Common Policy Framework. In addition,
FIPS 201-2 requires that Federal identity badges referred to as
PIV credentials, issued to Federal employees and Contractors comply
with the Standard and associated NIST Special Publications 800-73,
800-76, 800-78, and 800-79.</p>

common infrastructure for the authentication of the public and internal
Federal users for logical access to Federal e-Government applications
and electronic services. To support the government-wide implementation
of HSPD-12 and the Federal e-Authentication Initiative, GSA has
established Special Item Numbers (SINs) pertaining to Authentication Products

addition, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
has established the NIST Personal Identity Verification Program
(NPIVP) to evaluate integrated circuit chip cards and supplies against
conformance requirements contained in FIPS 201. GSA has established
the FIPS 201Evaluation Program to evaluate other supplies needed
for agency implementation of HSPD-12 requirements where normative
requirements are specified in FIPS 201 and to perform card and reader
interface testing for interoperability. Products that are approved
as FIPS-201 compliant through these evaluation and testing programs
may be offered directly through HSPD-12 Supplies and Services Components SIN
