                  This clause shall become operative only for any modification to this contract involving aggregate increases and/or decreases in costs, plus applicable profits, expected to exceed the threshold for the submission of certified cost or pricing data at FAR <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1106066.html#i1106066">15.403-4</a>(a)(1), except that this clause does not apply to a modification if an exception under FAR <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1105936.html#i1105936">15.403-1</a>(b) applies.</p>

                  If any price, including profit, negotiated in connection with any modification under this clause, was increased by any significant amount because (1) the Contractor or a subcontractor furnished certified cost or pricing data that were not complete, accurate, and current as certified in its Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, (2)a subcontractor or prospective subcontractor furnished the Contractor certified cost or pricing data that were not complete, accurate, and current as certified in the Contractor’s Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data, or (3) any of these parties furnished data of any description that were not accurate, the price shall be reduced accordingly and the contract shall be modified to reflect the reduction. This right to a price reduction is limited to that resulting from defects in data relating to modifications for which this clause becomes operative under paragraph (a) of this clause</p>

                  Any reduction in the contract price under paragraph (b) of this clause due to defective data from a prospective subcontractor that was not subsequently awarded the subcontract shall be limited to the amount, plus applicable overhead and profit markup, by which (1) the actual subcontract or (2) the actual cost to the Contractor, if there was no subcontract, was less than the prospective subcontract cost estimate submitted by the Contractor; provided, that the actual subcontract price was not itself affected by defective certified cost or pricing data.</p>

                              The Contractor or subcontractor was a sole source supplier or otherwise was in a superior bargaining position and thus the price of the contract would not have been modified even if accurate, complete, and current certified cost or pricing data had been submitted.</p>

                              The Contracting Officer should have known that the certified cost or pricing data in issue were defective even though the Contractor or subcontractor took no affirmative action to bring the character of the data to the attention of the Contracting Officer.</p>
