to the attention of the Contracting Officer and seek direction before
fabrication, construction, or installation of any affected work.

The Contractor shall be responsible to review all design information
(e.g. draft specifications and drawings) provided. The Contractor
shall be responsible for determining that the project as described
in the design information is constructible using commercially practicable
means and methods; that the construction work is described in the
design documents with sufficient completeness to enable pricing
of a complete project within the guaranteed maximum price; and that
the manner of presentation and organization of information in the
design documents enables accurate estimation of the cost of the work. </p>

Prior to establishment of the final estimated cost of work, the

instances that it has discovered or has been made aware of where
design errors and omissions affect the Contractor's ability to accurately
estimate the cost of the work.</p>

It is not the Contractor's responsibility to ensure that the contract

The Contractor is responsible to construct the project in accordance
with the drawings and specifications.  The final Estimated Cost
of the Construction Work (ECW) may be determined based upon incomplete
design documents.  In those instances in which the drawings and
specifications are not complete at the time the final ECW is established,
the Contractor shall exercise reasonable care and judgment to determine
the intent of the design and shall calculate the final ECW on the basis
of the quality of construction, materials, and finishes that can
be reasonably inferred from the design documents or other specified
sources.</p>
