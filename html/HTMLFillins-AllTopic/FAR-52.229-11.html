Procurement Payments, available via the internet at <a class="xref" href="www.irs.gov/w14" target="_blank">www.irs.gov/w14</a>.
Any exemption claimed and self-certified on the IRS Form W-14 is
subject to audit by the IRS. Any disputes regarding the imposition
and collection of the 26 U.S.C. 5000C tax are adjudicated by the
IRS as the <a class="xref" href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title26-section5000C&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" target="_blank">26 U.S.C. 5000C</a> tax

may, for a fee, seek advice from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
as to the proper tax treatment of a transaction. This is called
a private letter ruling. Also, the IRS may publish a revenue ruling,
which is an official interpretation by the IRS of the Internal Revenue
Code, related statutes, tax treaties, and regulations. A revenue
ruling is the conclusion of the IRS on how the law is applied to
a specific set of facts. For questions relating to the interpretation
of the IRS regulations go to <a class="xref" href="https://www.irs.gov/%E2%80%8Bhelp/%E2%80%8Btax-law-questions" target="_blank">https://www.irs.gov/help/tax-law-questions</a>.</p>
