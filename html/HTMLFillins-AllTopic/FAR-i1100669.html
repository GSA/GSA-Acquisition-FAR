                        When disagreements arise about a concern’s ability to perform, the contracting officer and the SBA shall make every effort to reach a resolution before the SBA takes final action on a COC. This shall be done through the complete exchange of information and in accordance with agency procedures. If agreement cannot be reached between the contracting officer and the SBA Area Office, the contracting officer shall request that the Area Office suspend action and refer the matter to SBA Headquarters for review. The SBA Area Office shall honor the request for a review if the contracting officer agrees to withhold award until the review process is concluded. Without an agreement to withhold award, the SBA Area Office will issue the COC in accordance with applicable SBA regulations.</p>

                        SBA Headquarters will furnish written notice to the procuring agency’s Director of the, Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) or, for the Department of Defense, the Director of the Office of Small Business Programs, or other designated official (with a copy to the contracting officer) that the case file has been received and that an appeal decision may be requested by an authorized official.</p>

                        If the contracting agency decides to file an appeal, it must notify SBA Headquarters through its procuring agency’s Director, OSDBU, or other designated official, within 10 business days (or a time period agreed upon by both agencies) that it intends to appeal the issuance of the COC.</p>

                              The COC applicant submitted false information or omitted materially adverse information; or</p>

                              The COC has been issued for more than 60 days (in which case the SBA may investigate the firm’s current circumstances).</p>

                        Denial of a COC by the SBA does not preclude a contracting officer from awarding a contract to the referred concern, nor does it prevent the concern from making an offer on any other procurement.</p>
