                  The contracting officer is responsible for determining when a proposed contract may require CAS coverage and for including the appropriate notice in the solicitation. The contracting officer must then ensure that the offeror has made the required solicitation certifications and that required Disclosure Statements are submitted. (Also see <span class="ph CFR">48 CFR 9903.201-3</span> and 9903.202 (FAR Appendix).)</p>

                  The contracting officer shall not award a CAS-covered contract until the cognizant Federal agency official (CFAO) has made a written determination that a required Disclosure Statement is adequate unless, in order to protect the Government's interest, the agency head, on a nondelegable basis, authorizes award without obtaining submission of the required Disclosure Statement (see <span class="ph CFR">48 CFR 9903.202-2</span>). In this event, the contractor shall submit the required Disclosure Statement and the CFAO shall make a determination of adequacy as soon as possible after the award.</p>
