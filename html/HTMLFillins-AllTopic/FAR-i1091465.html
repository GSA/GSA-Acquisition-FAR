                  If the contracting officer has determined that an exception applies because the cost of certain domestic construction material is unreasonable, in accordance with section <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1091446.html#i1091446">25.604</a>, then the contracting officer shall apply evaluation factors to the offer incorporating the use of such foreign construction material as follows:</p>
               <ol style="list-style-type:none;"><li>
                     <p class="p" id="i1091465__d1668e30">
                        <span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span>
                        Use an evaluation factor of 25 percent, applied to the total offered price of the contract, if foreign manufactured construction material is incorporated in the offer based on an exception for unreasonable cost of comparable domestic construction material requested by the offeror.</p>
                  </li><li>
                     <p class="p" id="i1091465__d1668e39">
                        <span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>
                        In addition, use an evaluation factor of 6 percent applied to the cost of foreign unmanufactured construction material incorporated in the offer based on an exception for unreasonable cost of comparable domestic unmanufactured construction material requested by the offeror.</p>
                  </li><li>
                     <p class="p" id="i1091465__d1668e48">
                        <span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span>
                        Total evaluated price = offered price + (.25 x offered price, if (a)(1) applies) + (.06 x cost of foreign unmanufactured construction material, if (a)(2) applies).</p>
                  </li></ol>
            </li><li>
               <p class="p" id="i1091465__d1668e59">
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span>
                  If the solicitation specifies award on the basis of factors in addition to cost or price, apply the evaluation factors as specified in paragraph (a) of this section and use the evaluated price in determining the offer that represents the best value to the Government</p>
            </li><li>
               <p class="p" id="i1091465__d1668e68">
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span>
                  Unless paragraph (b) applies, if two or more offers are equal in price, the contracting officer must give preference to an offer that does not include foreign construction material excepted at the request of the offeror on the basis of unreasonable cost.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p class="p" id="i1091465__d1668e77">
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span>
                  Offerors also may submit alternate offers based on use of equivalent domestic construction material to avoid possible rejection of the entire offer if the Government determines that an exception permitting use of a particular foreign construction material does not apply.</p>
            </li><li>
               <p class="p" id="i1091465__d1668e86">
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span>
                  If the contracting officer awards a contract to an offeror that proposed foreign construction material not listed in the applicable clause in the solicitation (paragraph (b)(3) of <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1054449.html#i1054449">52.225-21</a>, or paragraph (b)(3) of <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1054633.html#i1054633">52.225-23</a>), the contracting officer must add the excepted materials to the list in the contract clause.</p>
