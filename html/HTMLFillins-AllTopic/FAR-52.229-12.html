                        If
the Contractor is a foreign person and has only a partial or no
exemption to the withholding, the Contractor shall include the Department
of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service Form W-14, Certificate
of Foreign Contracting Party Receiving Federal Procurement Payments,
with each voucher or invoice submitted under this contract throughout
the period in which this status is applicable. The excise tax withholding
is applied at the payment level, not at the contract level. The
Contractor should revise each IRS Form W-14 submission to reflect
the exemption (if any) that applies to that particular invoice,
such as a different exemption applying. In the absence of a completed
IRS Form W-14 accompanying a payment request, the default withholding
percentage is 2 percent for the section 5000C withholding for that payment
request. Information about IRS Form W-14 and its separate instructions
is available via the internet at <a class="xref" href="www.irs.gov/%E2%80%8Bw14" target="_blank">www.irs.gov/w14</a>.</p>

                  The
Government will withhold a full 2 percent of each payment unless
the Contractor claims an exemption. If the Contractor enters a ratio
in Line 12 of the IRS Form W-14, the result of Line 11 divided by
Line 10, the Government will withhold from each payment an amount
equal to 2 percent multiplied by the contract ratio. If the Contractor
marks box 9 of the IRS Form W-14 (rather than completes Lines 10
through 12), the Contractor must identify and enter the specific
exempt and nonexempt amounts in Line 15 of the IRS Form W-14; the
Government will then withhold 2 percent only from the nonexempt
amount. See the IRS Form W-14 and its instructions.</p>

from the withholding under this clause are described at 26 CFR 1.5000C-1(d)(5)

Form W-14 is subject to audit by the IRS. Any disputes regarding

                  A taxpayer
may, for a fee, seek advice from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
as to the proper tax treatment of a transaction. This is called
a private letter ruling. Also, the IRS may publish a revenue ruling,
which is an official interpretation by the IRS of the Internal Revenue
Code, related statutes, tax treaties, and regulations. A revenue
ruling is the conclusion of the IRS on how the law is applied to
a specific set of facts. For questions relating to the interpretation
of the IRS regulations go to <a class="xref" href="https://www.irs.gov/%E2%80%8Bhelp/%E2%80%8Btax-law-questions" target="_blank">https://www.irs.gov/help/tax-law-questions</a>.</p>
