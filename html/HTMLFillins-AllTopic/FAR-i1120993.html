                  As required by the Small Business Act (<a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml;jsessionid=114A3287C7B3359E597506A31FC855B3" target="_blank">15 U.S.C.637(e))</a> and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (<a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml;jsessionid=114A3287C7B3359E597506A31FC855B3" target="_blank">41 U.S.C.1708</a>), contracting officers must disseminate information on proposed contract actions as follows:</p>

                        For proposed contract actions expected to exceed $25,000, by synopsizing in the GPE (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1120663.html#i1120663">5.201</a>).</p>

                        For proposed contract actions expected to exceed $15,000, but not expected to exceed $25,000, by displaying in a public place, or by any appropriate electronic means, an unclassified notice of the solicitation or a copy of the solicitation satisfying the requirements of <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1120855.html#i1120855">5.207</a>(c). The notice must include a statement that all responsible sources may submit a response which, if timely received, must be considered by the agency. The information must be posted not later than the date the solicitation is issued, and must remain posted for at least 10 days or until after quotations have been opened, whichever is later.</p>

                              If solicitations are posted instead of a notice, the contracting officer may employ various methods of satisfying the requirements of <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1120855.html#i1120855">5.207</a>(c). For example, the contracting officer may meet the requirements of <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1120855.html#i1120855">5.207</a>(c) by stamping the solicitation, by a cover sheet to the solicitation, or by placing a general statement in the display room.</p>

                              Contracting officers may use electronic posting of requirements in a place accessible by the general public at the Government installation to satisfy the public display requirement. Contracting offices using electronic systems for public posting that are not accessible outside the installation must periodically publicize the methods for accessing the information.</p>
