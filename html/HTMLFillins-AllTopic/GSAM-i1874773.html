If the Government elects to perform any such requirement, the Government and each of its contractors shall be entitled to access to any and all areas of the building, access to which is necessary to perform any such requirement, and the Lessor shall afford and facilitate such access. Alternatively, the Government may deduct from any payment under this lease, then or thereafter due, an amount which reflects the reduced value of the contract requirement not performed. No deduction from rent pursuant to this clause shall constitute a default by the Government under this lease. These remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to any other remedies which may be available under this lease or at law.</p>
