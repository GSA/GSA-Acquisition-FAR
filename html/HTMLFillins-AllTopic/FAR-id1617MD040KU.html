                   Contracts principally for remanufacturing
of equipment which is so extensive as to be equivalent to manufacturing
are subject to <a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml;jsessionid=114A3287C7B3359E597506A31FC855B3" target="_blank">41 U.S.C. chapter 65</a>, rather than to the Service
Contract Labor Standards statute. Remanufacturing shall be deemed
to be manufacturing when the criteria in either paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2)
of this section are met.</p>

                   Remanufacturing
does not include the repair of damaged or broken equipment which
does not require a complete teardown, overhaul, and rebuild as described
in subparagraphs(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this subsection, or the periodic
and routine maintenance, preservation, care, adjustment, upkeep,
or servicing of equipment to keep it in usable, serviceable, working order.
Such contracts typically are billed on an hourly rate (labor plus
materials and parts) basis. Any contract principally for this type
of work is subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute.
Examples of such work include the following:</p>
