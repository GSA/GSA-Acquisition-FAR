                        Construction contracts contain special provisions concerning contractor payments to subcontractors, along with special contractor certification requirements. The Office of Management and Budget has determined that these certifications must not be construed as final acceptance of the subcontractor’s performance. The certification in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1049425.html#i1049425">52.232-5</a>(c) implements this determination; however, certificates are still acceptable if the contractor deletes paragraph (c)(4) of <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1049425.html#i1049425">52.232-5</a> from the certificate.</p>
