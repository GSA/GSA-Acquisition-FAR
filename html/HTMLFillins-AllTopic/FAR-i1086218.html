                  The extent of allowability of the costs covered in this part applies broadly to many accounting systems in varying contract situations. Thus, the reasonableness, the allocability and the allowability under the specific cost principles at <a class="xref fm:Subparts" href="FAR-i1084539.html#i1084539">subparts&nbsp; 31.2</a>, <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1084503.html#i1084503">31.3</a>, <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1084403.html#i1084403">31.6</a>, and <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1084365.html#i1084365">31.7</a> of certain costs may be difficult to determine. To avoid possible subsequent disallowance or dispute based on unreasonableness, unallocability or unallowability under the specific cost principles at <a class="xref fm:Subparts" href="FAR-i1084539.html#i1084539">subparts&nbsp; 31.2</a>, <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1084503.html#i1084503">31.3</a>, <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1084403.html#i1084403">31.6</a>, and <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1084365.html#i1084365">31.7</a>, contracting officers and contractors should seek advance agreement on the treatment of special or unusual costs and on statistical sampling methodologies at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1084587.html#i1084587">31.201-6</a>(c). However, an advance agreement is not an absolute requirement and the absence of an advance agreement on any cost will not, in itself, affect the reasonableness, allocability or the allowability under the specific cost principles at <a class="xref fm:Subparts" href="FAR-i1084539.html#i1084539">subparts&nbsp; 31.2</a>, <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1084503.html#i1084503">31.3</a>, <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1084403.html#i1084403">31.6</a>, and <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1084365.html#i1084365">31.7</a> of that cost.</p>

                  Advance agreements may be negotiated either before or during a contract but should be negotiated before incurrence of the costs involved. The agreements must be in writing, executed by both contracting parties, and incorporated into applicable current and future contracts. An advance agreement shall contain a statement of its applicability and duration.</p>
