                           <p class="p" id="i1095633__d1488e135">

factors. The contractor had a Trafficking in Persons compliance
plan or awareness program at the time of the violation, was in compliance
with the plan at the time of the violation, and has taken appropriate
remedial actions for the violations, that may include reparation
to victims for such violations.</p>

a contracting officer to do so.</p>
