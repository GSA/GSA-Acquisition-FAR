                   If a proposed
acquisition is not exempt under FAR 5.202 or GSAR <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1861896">570.106</a>(e),
and is for a leasehold interest in real property estimated to exceed
10,000 square feet, then the contracting officer must publicize
the proposed acquisition in <span class="ph CHANGE 111 JULY 27, 2020">the

                   For leasehold acquisitions where
the solicitation requires the construction of a new building on
a preselected site, the contracting officer, in accordance with
the timeframes established in FAR 5.203, must publicize the proposed

                   &nbsp;Other than as identified
in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, the contracting officer
need not publicize the proposed acquisition of a leasehold interest
in real property, including expansion requests within the scope
of a lease (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="GSAM-i1855144.html#i1855144">570.403</a>), lease extensions
under the conditions defined in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="GSAM-i1855174.html#i1855174">570.405</a>,
and building alterations within the scope of a lease (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="GSAM-i1855188.html#i1855188">570.5</a>).
However, the contracting officer may publicize proposed lease acquisitions
of any dollar value or square footage in <span class="ph CHANGE 111 JULY 27, 2020">the GPE</span> or local newspapers
if, in the opinion of the contracting officer, doing so is necessary
to promote competition.</p>
