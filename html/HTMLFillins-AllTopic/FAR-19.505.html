                        In addition to the requirements set forth in (c)(1) of this section, when the end item being acquired is a kit of supplies or other goods, 50 percent of the total value of the components of the kit shall be manufactured in the United States or its outlying areas by small business concerns. Where the Government has specified an item for the kit which is not produced by U.S. small business concerns, such items shall be excluded from the 50 percent calculation.

For the purposes of the nonmanufacturer rule, the manufacturer of the end product being acquired is the concern that transforms raw materials and/or miscellaneous parts or components into the end product. Firms which only minimally alter the item being procured do not qualify as manufacturers of the end item, such as firms that add substances, parts, or components to an existing end item to modify its performance, will not be considered the end item manufacturer, where those identical modifications can be performed by and are available from the manufacturer of the existing end item.
