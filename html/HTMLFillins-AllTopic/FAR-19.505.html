Firms which only minimally alter the item being procured do not qualify as manufacturers of the end item, such as firms that add substances, parts, or components to an existing end item to modify its performance, will not be considered the end item manufacturer, where those identical modifications can be performed by and are available from the manufacturer of the existing end item.
