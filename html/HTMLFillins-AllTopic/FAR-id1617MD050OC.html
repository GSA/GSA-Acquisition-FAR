                  The Secretary of Labor has the authority to issue orders prescribing appropriate remedies, including, but not limited to, requiring the successor contractor to offer employment, in positions for which the employees are qualified, to service employees from the predecessor contract and payment of wages lost. (See <span class="ph CFR">29 CFR 9.24(a)</span>).</p>

                  After an investigation (see <span class="ph CFR">29 CFR 9.23</span>) and a determination by the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor, that lost wages or other monetary relief is due, the Administrator may direct that so much of the accrued payments due on either the contract or any other contract between the contractor and the Government shall be withheld as are necessary to pay the monies due. Upon the final order of the Secretary of Labor that such monies are due, the Administrator may direct that such withheld funds be transferred to the Department of Labor for disbursement. (See <span class="ph CFR">29 CFR 9.24(c)</span>).</p>

                  If the contracting officer or the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor, finds that the predecessor contractor has failed to provide the list required by <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1096236.html#i1096236">22.1204</a>, the contracting officer may, in his or her discretion, or on request by the Administrator, suspend contract payment until such time as the contractor provides the list to the contracting officer.</p>
