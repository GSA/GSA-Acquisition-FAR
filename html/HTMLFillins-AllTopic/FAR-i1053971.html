An offeror requesting a determination regarding the inapplicability of the Buy American statute should submit the request to the Contracting Officer in time to allow a determination before submission of offers. The offeror shall include the information and applicable supporting data required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of the clause at FAR <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1053788.html#i1053788">52.225-9</a> in the request.

                        The Government will evaluate an offer requesting exception to the requirements of the Buy American statute, based on claimed unreasonable cost of domestic construction material, by adding to the offered price the appropriate percentage of the cost of such foreign construction material, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of the clause at FAR <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1053788.html#i1053788">52.225-9</a>.</p>
