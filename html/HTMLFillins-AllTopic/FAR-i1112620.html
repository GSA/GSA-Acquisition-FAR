                  When evaluation factors are used, the contracting officer may insert a provision substantially the same as the provision at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1060530.html#i1060530">52.212-2</a>, Evaluation-Commercial Items, in solicitations for commercial items or comply with the procedures in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1112289.html#i1112289">13.106</a> if the acquisition is being made using simplified acquisition procedures. When the provision at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1060530.html#i1060530">52.212-2</a> is used, paragraph (a) of the provision shall be tailored to the specific acquisition to describe the evaluation factors and relative importance of those factors. However, when using the simplified acquisition procedures in <a class="xref fm:Part" href="FAR-i1112458.html#i1112458">part&nbsp; 13</a>, contracting officers are not required to describe the relative importance of evaluation factors.</p>

                  Offers shall be evaluated in accordance with the criteria contained in the solicitation. For many commercial items, the criteria need not be more detailed than technical (capability of the item offered to meet the agency need), price and past performance. Technical capability may be evaluated by how well the proposed products meet the Government requirement instead of predetermined subfactors. Solicitations for commercial items do not have to contain subfactors for technical capability when the solicitation adequately describes the itemâ€™s intended use. A technical evaluation would normally include examination of such things as product literature, product samples (if requested), technical features and warranty provisions. Past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with the procedures in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1112289.html#i1112289">13.106</a> or <a class="xref fm:Subpart" href="FAR-i1108536.html#i1108536">subpart&nbsp; 15.3</a>, as applicable. The contracting officer shall ensure the instructions provided in the provision at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i52_212-1.html#i52_212-1">52.212-1</a>, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, and the evaluation criteria provided in the provision at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1060530.html#i1060530">52.212-2</a>, Evaluation-Commercial Items, are in agreement.</p>

                  Select the offer that is most advantageous to the Government based on the factors contained in the solicitation. Fully document the rationale for selection of the successful offeror including discussion of any trade-offs considered.</p>
