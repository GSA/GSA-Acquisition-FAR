                  The Contractor warrants that the supplies identified as line items __________ [<em class="ph i">offeror insert Schedule line item number</em>] in the Schedule are, except for modifications required by the contract specifications, supplies for which it has an established price. The term “established price” means a price that (1)is an established catalog or market price for a commercial item sold in substantial quantities to the general public, and (2)is the net price after applying any standard trade discounts offered by the Contractor. The Contractor further warrants that, as of the date of this contract, any difference between the unit prices stated in the contract for these line items and the Contractor’s established prices for like quantities of the nearest commercial equivalents are due to compliance with contract specifications and with any contract requirements for preservation, packaging, and packing beyond standard commercial practice.</p>

The decrease shall apply to those items delivered on and after the effective date of the decrease in the Contractor’s established price, and this contract shall be modified accordingly.</p>
