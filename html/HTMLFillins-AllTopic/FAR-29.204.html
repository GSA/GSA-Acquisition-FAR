                  Title
26 U.S.C. 5000C and its implementing regulations at 26 CFR 1.5000C-1
through 1.5000C-7 require acquiring agencies to collect this excise
tax via withholding on applicable contract payments (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-29.402-3.html#id205VI010V4Y">29.402-3</a>, 31.205-41(b)(8)).
Agencies merely withhold the tax (section 5000C tax) for the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS). All substantive issues regarding the underlying
section 5000C tax, e.g., the imposition of, and exemption from the
tax, are matters under the jurisdiction of the IRS. The contracting
officer will refer all questions relating to the interpretation
of the IRS regulations to <a class="xref" href="https://www.irs.gov/%E2%80%8Bhelp/%E2%80%8Btax-law-questions" target="_blank">https://www.irs.gov/help/tax-law-questions</a>.</p>

                  In
accordance with the clause <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-52.229-12.html#id205VI30B0ZS">52.229-12</a>, Tax on Certain
Foreign Procurements, contractors that are subject to the section 5000C
tax will complete IRS Form W-14, Certificate of Foreign Contracting
Party Receiving Federal Procurement Payments, and submit this form
with each voucher or invoice. In the absence of a completed IRS
Form W-14 accompanying a payment request, the default withholding
percentage is 2 percent for the section 5000C withholding for that
payment request. Information about IRS Form W-14 is available via
the internet at <a class="xref" href="www.irs.gov/%E2%80%8Bw14" target="_blank">www.irs.gov/w14</a>.</p>

                        The
exemptions at 26 CFR 1.5000C-1(d)(5) through (7) must be claimed
by the offeror when it submits an IRS Form W-14 with the offer.
If not submitted with the offer, exemptions will not be applied
to the contract.</p>

                        Any
exemption claimed and self-certified on the IRS Form W-14 is subject
to audit by the IRS. Any disputes regarding the imposition and collection
of the section 5000C tax are adjudicated by the IRS as the section
5000C tax is a tax matter, not a contract issue.</p>
