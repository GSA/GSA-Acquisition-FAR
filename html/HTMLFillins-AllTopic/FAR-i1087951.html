                  <em class="ph i">Workers’ compensation and employer’s liability</em>. Contractors are required to comply with applicable Federal and State workers’ compensation and occupational disease statutes. If occupational diseases are not compensable under those statutes, they shall be covered under the employer’s liability section of the insurance policy, except when contract operations are so commingled with a contractor’s commercial operations that it would not be practical to require this coverage. Employer’s liability coverage of at least $100,000 shall be required, except in States with exclusive or monopolistic funds that do not permit workers’ compensation to be written by private carriers. (See <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1087897.html#i1087897">28.305</a>(c) for treatment of contracts subject to the Defense Base Act.)</p>
