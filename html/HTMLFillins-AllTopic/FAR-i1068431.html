                        When use of the inventory basis is not practicable or will unduly delay settlement, the total-cost basis (<a class="xref" href="https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/settlement-proposal-total-cost-basis" target="_blank">SF&nbsp;1436</a>) may be used if approved in advance by the TCO as in the following examples:</p>

                              If, under the contractor’s accounting system, unit costs for work in process and finished products cannot readily be established.</p>

                        When the total-cost basis is used under a complete termination, the contractor must itemize costs incurred under the contract up to the effective date of termination. The costs of settlements with subcontractors and applicable settlement expenses must also be added. An allowance for profit (<a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1068337.html#i1068337">49.202</a>) or adjustment for loss (<a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1068361.html#i1068361">49.203</a>(c)) must be made. The contract price for all end items delivered or to be delivered and accepted must be deducted. All unliquidated advance and progress payments and disposal and other credits known when the proposal is submitted must also be deducted.</p>
