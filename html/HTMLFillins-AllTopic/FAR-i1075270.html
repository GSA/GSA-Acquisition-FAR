                        In deciding whether the use of predetermined rates would be appropriate for the educational institution concerned, the agency should consider both the stability of the institution’s indirect costs and bases over a period of years and any anticipated changes in the amount of the direct and indirect costs.</p>

                              If the proposal is found to be generally acceptable, the agency shall negotiate the predetermined rates with the institution. The rates should be based on an audit of the institution’s costs for the year immediately preceding the year in which the rates are being negotiated. If this is not possible, an earlier audit may be used, but appropriate steps should be taken to identify and evaluate significant variations in costs incurred or in bases used that may have a bearing on the reasonableness of the proposed rates. However, in the case of smaller contracts (<em class="ph i">i.e.,</em> contracts that do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold), an audit made at an earlier date is acceptable if-</p>

                                    It is reasonably apparent that another audit would have little effect on the rates finally agreed upon and the potential for overpayment of indirect cost is relatively insignificant.</p>
