                        All service furnished by the Contractor shall be measured by suitable metering equipment of standard manufacture, to be furnished, installed, maintained, repaired, calibrated, and read by the Contractor at its expense. When more than a single meter is installed at a service location, the readings thereof may be billed conjunctively, if appropriate. In the event any meter fails to register (or registers incorrectly) the service furnished, the parties shall agree upon the length of time of meter malfunction and the quantity of service delivered during such period of time. An appropriate adjustment shall be made to the next invoice for the purpose of correcting such errors. However, any meter which registers not more than <textarea name="52.241-6_d3580e43" style="width:2.52in; " cols="20" rows="1" placeholder="___"></textarea> percent slow or fast shall be deemed correct.</p>

                        At the written request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall make additional tests of any or all such meters in the presence of Government representatives. The cost of such additional tests shall be borne by the Government if the percentage of errors is found to be not more than <textarea name="52.241-6_d3580e91" style="width:2.52in; " cols="20" rows="1" placeholder="___"></textarea> percent slow or fast.</p>
