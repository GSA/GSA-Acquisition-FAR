assistance in preparing the Appeal File, and consult with designated
litigation counsel to determine requirements specific to the appeal,

a portion of the contract is acceptable.</p>

counsel within 20 days of receiving notice of appeal, or shorter,

to Complaint.</em> When an appeal is filed at the CBCA or COFC, the
contractor is required to file a formal pleading called a Complaint,
which sets forth the allegations of fact upon which the claim is
based. The Government, except for the situation discussed below,
is obligated to respond to the Complaint by admitting, denying,
or otherwise responding to the contractor’s allegations in a formal
pleading called the Answer. The contracting officer shall assist
designated litigation counsel in the drafting of the Answer by advising
whether the contractor’s allegations of fact should be admitted
or denied. If a response to an allegation in the complaint requires
information in the possession of other GSA personnel, the contracting
officer shall conduct sufficient research reasonably necessary in
order to form a belief as to the truth of the allegation. If the
information necessary to form a belief as to the truth of the allegation
is not in GSA’s possession, the contracting officer shall so advise
designated litigation counsel. In some cases, the Government may
respond to the Complaint by filing a motion to dismiss in lieu of
filing an Answer. Designated litigation counsel will advise the contracting
officer if a motion to dismiss will be filed.</p>

After the complaint and answer are filed with the CBCA or COFC,
each party will usually commence discovery. The contracting officer
shall assist designated litigation counsel in responding to all
discovery requests, including providing information in response
to interrogatories, identifying and locating requested documents,
and assisting with production of witnesses for depositions.</p>
