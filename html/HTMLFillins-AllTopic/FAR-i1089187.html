The basic clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1052520.html#i1052520">52.227-14</a>, Rights in Data-General, enables the contractor to protect qualifying limited rights data and restricted computer software by withholding the data from the Government and instead delivering form, fit, and function data.</p>

                  <em class="ph i">Alternate definition of limited rights data</em>. For contracts that do not require the development, use, or delivery of items, components, or processes that are intended to be acquired by or for the Government, an agency may adopt the alternate definition of limited rights data set forth in Alternate I to the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1052520.html#i1052520">52.227-14</a>. The alternate definition does not require that the data pertain to items, components, or processes developed at private expense; but rather that the data were developed at private expense and embody a trade secret or are commercial or financial and confidential or privileged.</p>

                        The clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1052520.html#i1052520">52.227-14</a> with its Alternate II enables the Government to require delivery of limited rights data rather than allow the contractor to withhold the data. To obtain delivery, the contract may identify and specify data to be delivered, or the contracting officer may require, by written request during contract performance, the delivery of data that has been withheld or identified to be withheld under paragraph (g)(1) of the clause. In addition, the contract may specifically identify data that are not to be delivered under Alternate II or which, if delivered, will be delivered with limited rights. The limited rights obtained by the Government are set forth in the Limited Rights Notice contained in paragraph (g)(3) of Alternate II. Agencies shall not, without permission of the contractor, use limited rights data for purposes of manufacture or disclose the data outside the Government except as set forth in the Notice. Any disclosure by the Government shall be subject to prohibition against further use and disclosure by the recipient. The following are examples of specific purposes that may be adopted by an agency in its supplement and added to the Limited Rights Notice of paragraph (g)(3) of Alternate II of the clause:</p>

                        The provision at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1052648.html#i1052648">52.227-15</a>, Representation of Limited Rights Data and Restricted Computer Software, helps the contracting officer to determine whether the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1052520.html#i1052520">52.227-14</a> should be used with its Alternate II. This provision requests that an offeror state whether limited rights data are likely to be delivered. Where limited rights data are expected to be delivered, use Alternate II. Where negotiations are based on an unsolicited proposal, the need for Alternate II of the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1052520.html#i1052520">52.227-14</a> should be addressed during negotiations or discussions, and if Alternate II was not included initially it may be added by modification, if needed, during contract performance.</p>

                        If data that would otherwise qualify as limited rights data is delivered as a computer database, the data shall be treated as limited rights data, rather than restricted computer software, for the purposes of paragraph (g) of the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1052520.html#i1052520">52.227-14</a>.</p>

                        In considering whether to use Alternate III, contracting officers should note that, unlike other data, computer software is also an end item in itself.

                        The restricted rights set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this subsection are the minimum rights the Government normally obtains with restricted computer software and will automatically apply when such software is acquired under the Restricted Rights Notice of paragraph (g)(4) of Alternate III of the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1052520.html#i1052520">52.227-14</a>. However, the contracting officer may specify different rights in the contract, consistent with the purposes and needs for which the software is to be acquired. For example, the contracting officer should consider any networking needs or any requirements for use of the computer software from remote terminals. Also, in addressing such needs, the scope of the restricted rights may be different for the documentation accompanying the computer software than for the programs and databases. Any additions to, or limitations on, the restricted rights set forth in the Restricted Rights Notice of paragraph (g)(4) of Alternate III of the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1052520.html#i1052520">52.227-14</a> shall be expressly stated in the contract or in a collateral agreement incorporated in and made part of the contract, and the notice modified accordingly.</p>
