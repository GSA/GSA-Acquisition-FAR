                  The Government recognizes that the line items established in this solicitation may not conform to the Offerorâ€™s practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in acceptance of deliverables and processing payments. Therefore, the Offeror is invited to propose alternative line items for which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Offeror.</p>

                  The Offeror may submit one or more additional proposals with alternative line items, provided that alternative line items are consistent with <a class="xref fm:Subpart" href="FAR-iSubpart_4_10.html#iSubpart_4_10">subpart&nbsp; 4.10</a> of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. However, acceptance of an alternative proposal is a unilateral decision made solely at the discretion of the Government. Offers that do not comply with the line items specified in this solicitation may be determined to be nonresponsive or unacceptable.</p>
