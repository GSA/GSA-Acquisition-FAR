The clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1060971.html#i1060971">52.212-4</a> permits the Government to terminate a contract for commercial items either for the convenience of the Government or for cause. However, the paragraphs in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1060971.html#i1060971">52.212-4</a> entitled “Termination for the Government’s Convenience” and “Termination for Cause” contain concepts which differ from those contained in the termination clauses prescribed in <a class="xref fm:Part" href="FAR-i1069121.html#i1069121">part&nbsp; 49</a>. Consequently, the requirements of <a class="xref fm:Part" href="FAR-i1069121.html#i1069121">part&nbsp; 49</a> do not apply when terminating contracts for commercial items and contracting officers shall follow the procedures in this section. Contracting officers may continue to use <a class="xref fm:Part" href="FAR-i1069121.html#i1069121">part&nbsp; 49</a> as guidance to the extent that <a class="xref fm:Part" href="FAR-i1069121.html#i1069121">part&nbsp; 49</a> does not conflict with this section and the language of the termination paragraphs in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR-i1060971.html#i1060971">52.212-4</a>.</p>

                        The Government’s rights after a termination for cause shall include all the remedies available to any buyer in the marketplace.

                              Any charges the contractor can demonstrate directly resulted from the termination.

                        Generally, the parties should mutually agree upon the requirements of the termination proposal. The parties must balance the Government’s need to obtain sufficient documentation to support payment to the contractor against the goal of having a simple and expeditious settlement.</p>
