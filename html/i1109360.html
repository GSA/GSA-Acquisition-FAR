In different types of acquisitions, the relative importance of cost or price may vary. For example, in acquisitions where the requirement is clearly definable and the risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal, cost or price may play a dominant role in source selection. The less definitive the requirement, the more development work required, or the greater the performance risk, the more technical or past performance considerations may play a dominant role in source selection.</p>

                  Exchanges of information among all interested parties, from the earliest identification of a requirement through receipt of proposals, are encouraged. Any exchange of information must be consistent with procurement integrity requirements (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="i1125070.html#i1124683">3.104</a>). Interested parties include potential offerors, end users, Government acquisition and supporting personnel, and others involved in the conduct or outcome of the acquisition.</p>

                  The purpose of exchanging information is to improve the understanding of Government requirements and industry capabilities, thereby allowing potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government’s requirements, and enhancing the Government’s ability to obtain quality supplies and services, including construction, at reasonable prices, and increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award.</p>

An early exchange of information among industry and the program manager, contracting officer, and other participants in the acquisition process can identify and resolve concerns regarding the acquisition strategy, including proposed contract type, terms and conditions, and acquisition planning schedules; the feasibility of the requirement, including performance requirements, statements of work, and data requirements; the suitability of the proposal instructions and evaluation criteria, including the approach for assessing past performance information; the availability of reference documents; and any other industry concerns or questions.

                  General information about agency mission needs and future requirements may be disclosed at any time. After release of the solicitation, the contracting officer must be the focal point of any exchange with potential offerors. When specific information about a proposed acquisition that would be necessary for the preparation of proposals is disclosed to one or more potential offerors, that information must be made available to the public as soon as practicable, but no later than the next general release of information, in order to avoid creating an unfair competitive advantage. Information provided to a potential offeror in response to its request must not be disclosed if doing so would reveal the potential offeror’s confidential business strategy, and is protected under <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="i1125070.html#i1124683">3.104</a> or <a class="xref fm:Subpart" href="i1094093.html#i1093980">subpart 24.2</a>. When conducting a presolicitation or preproposal conference, materials distributed at the conference should be made available to all potential offerors, upon request.</p>

The resubmission shall be considered as if it were received at the date and time of the original unreadable submission for the purpose of determining timeliness under <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1109089">15.208</a>(a), provided the offeror complies with the time and format requirements for resubmission prescribed by the contracting officer.</p>

                  Proposal evaluation is an assessment
of the proposal and the offeror’s ability to perform the prospective
contract successfully. An agency shall evaluate competitive proposals
and then assess their relative qualities solely on the factors and subfactors
specified in the solicitation. Evaluations may be conducted using
any rating method or combination of methods, including color or
adjectival ratings, numerical weights, and ordinal rankings. The
relative strengths, deficiencies, significant weaknesses, and risks
supporting proposal evaluation shall be documented in the contract
file.</p>

                        <em class="ph i">Cost
or price evaluation</em>. Normally, competition establishes price
reasonableness. Therefore, when contracting on a firm-fixed-price
or fixed-price with economic price adjustment basis, comparison
of the proposed prices will usually satisfy the requirement to perform
a price analysis, and a cost analysis need not be performed. In
limited situations, a cost analysis (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1105936">15.403-1</a>(c)(1)(i)(B))
may be appropriate to establish reasonableness of the otherwise
successful offeror's price. When contracting on a cost-reimbursement
basis, evaluations shall include a cost realism analysis to determine
what the Government should realistically expect to pay for the proposed
effort, the offeror's understanding of the work, and the offeror's
ability to perform the contract. Cost realism analyses may also
be used on fixed-price incentive contracts or, in exceptional cases,
on other competitive fixed-price-type contracts (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1105936">15.403-1</a>(d)(3)).
(See <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="i1078064.html#i1077986">37.115</a> for
uncompensated overtime evaluation.) The contracting officer shall
document the cost or price evaluation.</p>

Negotiations are exchanges, in either a competitive or sole source
environment, between the Government and offerors, that are undertaken
with the intent of allowing the offeror to revise its proposal.
These negotiations may include bargaining. Bargaining includes persuasion,
alteration of assumptions and positions, give-and-take, and may
apply to price, schedule, technical requirements, type of contract, or
other terms of a proposed contract. When negotiations are conducted
in a competitive acquisition, they take place after establishment
of the competitive range and are called discussions.</p>

The head of the contracting activity (HCA) may, without power of
delegation, waive the requirement for submission of certified cost
or pricing data in exceptional cases. The authorization for the
waiver and the supporting rationale shall be in writing. The HCA
may consider waiving the requirement if the price can be determined
to be fair and reasonable without submission of certified cost or
pricing data. For example, if certified cost or pricing data were furnished
on previous production buys and the contracting officer determines
such data are sufficient, when combined with updated data, a waiver
may be granted. If the HCA has waived the requirement for submission
of certified cost or pricing data, the contractor or higher-tier
subcontractor to whom the waiver relates shall be considered as
having been required to provide certified cost or pricing data.
Consequently, award of any lower-tier subcontract expected to exceed
the certified cost or pricing data threshold requires the submission
of certified cost or pricing data unless-</p>

fair and reasonable whenever the contracting officer acquires a
commercial item (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1106135">15.404-1</a>(b)). The fact that a
price is included in a catalog does not, in and of itself, make
it fair and reasonable. If the contracting officer cannot determine
whether an offered price is fair and reasonable, even after obtaining
additional data from sources other than the offeror, then the contracting
officer shall require the offeror to submit data other than certified
cost or pricing data to support further analysis (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1106135">15.404-1</a>).
This data may include history of sales to non-governmental and governmental entities,
cost data, or any other information the contracting officer requires
to determine the price is fair and reasonable. Unless an exception
under <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1105936">15.403-1</a>(b)(1)

submitted by the offeror include, at a minimum, appropriate data

been sold, adequate for determining the reasonableness of the price.</p>

concludes that none of the exceptions in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1105936">15.403-1</a>(b)

                        Price analysis is the process
of examining and evaluating a proposed price without evaluating
its separate cost elements and proposed profit. Unless an exception
from the requirement to obtain certified cost or pricing data applies
under <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1105936">15.403-1</a>(b)(1)
or (b)(2), at a minimum, the contracting officer shall obtain appropriate
data, without certification, on the prices at which the same or
similar items have previously been sold and determine if the data
is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price. Price
analysis may include evaluating data other than certified cost or
pricing data obtained from the offeror or contractor when there is
no other means for determining a fair and reasonable price. Contracting
officers shall obtain data other than certified cost or pricing
data from the offeror or contractor for all acquisitions (including
commercial item acquisitions), if that is the contracting officer’s
only means to determine the price to be fair and reasonable.</p>

This subsection prescribes policies for establishing the profit
or fee portion of the Government prenegotiation objective in price
negotiations based on cost analysis.</p>

                        Profit or fee prenegotiation objectives
do not necessarily represent net income to contractors. Rather,
they represent that element of the potential total remuneration
that contractors may receive for contract performance over and above allowable
costs. This potential remuneration element and the Government’s
estimate of allowable costs to be incurred in contract performance
together equal the Government’s total prenegotiation objective.
Just as actual costs may vary from estimated costs, the contractor’s
actual realized profit or fee may vary from negotiated profit or
fee, because of such factors as efficiency of performance, incurrence
of costs the Government does not recognize as allowable, and the
contract type.</p>

                        It is in the Government’s interest
to offer contractors opportunities for financial rewards sufficient
to stimulate efficient contract performance, attract the best capabilities
of qualified large and small business concerns to Government contracts,
and maintain a viable industrial base.</p>

                        Both the Government and contractors
should be concerned with profit as a motivator of efficient and
effective contract performance. Negotiations aimed merely at reducing
prices by reducing profit, without proper recognition of the function
of profit, are not in the Government’s interest. Negotiation of
extremely low profits, use of historical averages, or automatic
application of predetermined percentages to total estimated costs
do not provide proper motivation for optimum contract performance.</p>

include how labor in the overhead pools would be treated if it were
direct labor, whether elements within the pools are routine expenses

cost risk in a closely priced firm-fixed-price contract under which
it agrees to perform a complex undertaking on time and at a predetermined
price. Some firm-fixed-price contracts may entail substantially
less cost risk than others because, for example, the contract task
is less complex or many of the contractor’s costs are known at the
time of price agreement, in which case the risk factor should be
reduced accordingly. The contractor assumes the least cost risk
in a cost-plus-fixed-fee level-of-effort contract, under which it
is reimbursed those costs determined to be allocable and allowable,
plus the fixed fee.</p>

                  The purpose of performing cost or price analysis is to develop a negotiation position that permits the contracting officer and the offeror an opportunity to reach agreement on a fair and reasonable price. A fair and reasonable price does not require that agreement be reached on every element of cost, nor is it mandatory that the agreed price be within the contracting officer’s initial negotiation position. Taking into consideration the advisory recommendations, reports of contributing specialists, and the current status of the contractor’s purchasing system, the contracting officer is responsible for exercising the requisite judgment needed to reach a negotiated settlement with the offeror and is solely responsible for the final price agreement. However, when significant audit or other specialist recommendations are not adopted, the contracting officer should provide rationale that supports the negotiation result in the price negotiation documentation.</p>
            </li>

                  The contracting officer’s primary concern is the overall price the Government will actually pay. The contracting officer’s objective is to negotiate a contract of a type and with a price providing the contractor the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance. The negotiation of a contract type and a price are related and should be considered together with the issues of risk and uncertainty to the contractor and the Government. Therefore, the contracting officer should not become preoccupied with any single element and should balance the contract type, cost, and profit or fee negotiated to achieve a total result-a price that is fair and reasonable to both the Government and the contractor.</p>
            </li>

                  The Government’s cost objective and proposed pricing arrangement directly affect the profit or fee objective. Because profit or fee is only one of several interrelated variables, the contracting officer shall not agree on profit or fee without concurrent agreement on cost and type of contract.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li abc H5_abc">

                  If, however, the contractor insists on a price or demands a profit or fee that the contracting officer considers unreasonable, and the contracting officer has taken all authorized actions (including determining the feasibility of developing an alternative source) without success, the contracting officer shall refer the contract action to a level above the contracting officer. Disposition of the action should be documented.</p>

closing or cutoff dates when appropriate in order to minimize delays
associated with proposal updates. Closing or cutoff dates should
be included as part of the data submitted with the proposal and,
before agreement on price, data should be updated by the contractor
to the latest closing or cutoff dates for which the data are available.
Use of cutoff dates coinciding with reports is acceptable, as certain
data may not be reasonably available before normal periodic closing
dates (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em>actual indirect
costs). Data within the contractor’s or a subcontractor’s organization
on matters significant to contractor management and to the Government
will be treated as reasonably available. What is significant depends

                  When certified cost or pricing data are required, offerors are required to describe any forward pricing rate agreements (FPRAs) in each specific pricing proposal to which the rates apply and to identify the latest cost or pricing data already submitted in accordance with the FPRA. All data submitted in connection with the FPRA, updated as necessary, form a part of the total data that the offeror certifies to be accurate, complete, and current at the time of agreement on price for an initial contract or for a contract modification.

Conditions that may affect the agreement’s validity shall be reported promptly to the ACO.

                        Should-cost reviews are a specialized form of cost analysis. Should-cost reviews differ from traditional evaluation methods because they do not assume that a contractor’s historical costs reflect efficient and economical operation. Instead, these reviews evaluate the economy and efficiency of the contractor’s existing work force, methods, materials, equipment, real property, operating systems, and management. These reviews are accomplished by a multi-functional team of Government contracting, contract administration, pricing, audit, and engineering representatives. The objective of should-cost reviews is to promote both short and long-range improvements in the contractor’s economy and efficiency in order to reduce the cost of performance of Government contracts. In addition, by providing rationale for any recommendations and quantifying their impact on cost, the Government will be better able to develop realistic objectives for negotiation.</p>

                        There are two types of should-cost reviews-program should-cost review (see paragraph (b) of this subsection) and overhead should-cost review (see paragraph (c) of this subsection). These should-cost reviews may be performed together or independently. The scope of a should-cost review can range from a large-scale review examining the contractor’s entire operation (including plant-wide overhead and selected major subcontractors) to a small-scale tailored review examining specific portions of a contractor’s operation.</p>

It is normally used to evaluate and negotiate an FPRA with the contractor. When an overhead should-cost review is conducted, a separate audit report is required.</p>

If it is conducted in conjunction with a program should-cost review, a separate overhead should-cost review report is not required. However, the findings and recommendations of the overhead should-cost team, or any separate overhead should-cost review report, shall be provided to the ACO. The ACO should use this information to form the basis for the Government position in negotiating an FPRA with the contractor. The ACO shall establish a follow-up plan to monitor the correction of the uneconomical or inefficient practices.</p>

There is a clear distinction between submitting certified cost or

documents without identification. The requirement for submission
of certified cost or pricing data is met when all accurate certified
cost or pricing data reasonably available to the offeror have been
submitted, either actually or by specific identification, to the
Contracting Officer or an authorized representative. As later data
come into your possession, it should be submitted promptly to the
Contracting Officer in a manner that clearly shows how the data
relate to the offeror’s price proposal. The requirement for submission
of certified cost or pricing data continues up to the time of agreement
on price, or an earlier date agreed upon between the parties if

                  An unsolicited proposal may include
data that the offeror does not want disclosed to the public for
any purpose or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes.
If the offeror wishes to restrict the data, the title page must
be marked with the following legend:</p>

proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government
and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed-in whole or in part-for
any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. However, if a
contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of-or in connection
with-the submission of these data, the Government shall have the
right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided
in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's
right to use information contained in these data if they are obtained
from another source without restriction. The data subject to this
restriction are contained in Sheets [<em class="ph i">insert
numbers or other identification of sheets</em>].</p>

                  The offeror shall also mark each
