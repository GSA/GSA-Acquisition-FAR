         <p class="p List1">(a) Contracting officers shall maintain an account in Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF), which provides access to Electronic Document Access (EDA) to ensure their ability to validate and verify data and documents distributed to EDA, as necessary.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Agencies shall perform, upon deployment of any contract writing system or other source of contractual documents to be posted to EDA, an analysis to verify adequate controls are in place to ensure that contract documents including attachments, and contract data posted to EDA are accurate representations of the contract. Analyses performed shall include the following—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) For documents posted in document formats (e.g., Portable Document Format (PDF)), verification that the electronic versions of contract documents posted to EDA are accurate representations of the contract; however, the electronic version is not required to display visual signatures; and</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) For data sent to EDA in the data standards at PGI <span class="ph PGIxref">
               <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="PGI_204.201.html#DFARS-PGI_PGI_204.201">204.201</a>
            </span>, review of the data posted to EDA against the contract documents verified under PGI <span class="ph PGIxref">
               <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="PGI_204.270.html#DFARS-PGI_PGI_204.270">204.270</a>
            </span>(b)(1) to ensure the contract data rendered in EDA is an accurate representation of the underlying contract. To facilitate this review process, all feeds of data to EDA in the Procurement Data Standard are initially placed in a view only evaluation mode, where the data is not available to other systems or outside users pending verification. Upon completion of the review of data, contracting organizations shall notify the EDA program office of the results of the review, with a list of the issuing offices of the contractual actions, the identifier of the system sending the actions, the version or versions of the data standards to which the review applies, and the locations of the systems sending the actions, directing one of the following decisions—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Delete all data sent to date (in this case the system remains in evaluation status pending further review);</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Delete all data sent to date, and change all subsequent data from 'evaluation' to 'compliant' status; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Retain all data sent to date, and change all subsequent data from 'evaluation' to 'compliant' status.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Contract deficiency reports</em>. </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Contracting officers and all individuals tasked with creating, managing, or viewing contract deficiency reports (CDRs) shall establish and maintain an account in WAWF. </p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Agencies that award or administer contracts, or perform pay office functions, should assign individuals within their organization to create, manage, and view CDRs within WAWF based on the following CDR user roles: initiator, reviewer, assignee, and view only.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The contracting officer shall correct contract deficiencies identified in a CDR and document the steps taken to resolve the deficiency in the CDR. </p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) <em class="ph i">The CDR process</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) <em class="ph i">Creation</em>. A CDR is created when a deficiency is identified in the procurement instrument. A list of types of CDR deficiencies is available at http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/eb/procurement_data_standard.html. The specifics of the deficiency shall be documented in the description in enough detail to provide the assignee an understanding of the problem. </p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Approval</em>. Once a CDR is created, the initiator shall route the CDR to their local approval official for review. </p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) <em class="ph i">Assignment</em>. Once a CDR is approved, it is routed to the appropriate contracting activity for action. </p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) <em class="ph i">Acceptance</em>. A CDR must be accepted or returned by the contracting activity. If a CDR is determined to have been incorrectly assigned, the contracting activity can reassign the CDR to the proper organization (if known) or reject the CDR. </p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) <em class="ph i">Resolution</em>. The assignee shall document the actions taken to resolve a CDR. If a modification has been issued to resolve the deficiency, it shall be identified in the CDR. Once all deficiencies identified on a CDR have been resolved, mark the CDR as resolved. All CDRs should be resolved within 30 days of approval.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vi) <em class="ph i">Close</em>. After resolution of a CDR, the initiator of the CDR can accept the resolution and manually close the CDR or return it to the assignee for further action. CDRs not manually closed or returned by the initiator to the assignee within 60 days after resolution will automatically be closed. Once the CDR is closed, a notification is generated advising that the CDR is closed.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Additional information on the CDR module of WAWF is available at https://wawf.eb.mil.</p>
