						            &nbsp;Any protester filing an agency protest has the choice of requesting either that the contracting officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest. If the protest is silent on this matter, the contracting officer will decide the protest. If a party requests a review at a level above the contracting officer, the Agency Protest Official will decide the protest. The decision by the Agency Protest Official for GSA is an alternative to a decision by the contracting officer on a protest. The Agency Protest Official for GSA will not consider an appeal of the contracting officer’s decision on an agency protest.</p>

The time period may be reduced if the GAO so decides. If the contracting officer cannot complete the Statement of Fact and Position and the compilation of documents within the time, the contracting officer must promptly telephone the designated protest counsel with the reason for the delay. The designated protest counsel has the discretion to authorize or disapprove the request; if the extension would delay submission of GSA’s report to GAO beyond 30 days from receipt of the protest, the designated protest counsel must first consult with GAO.</p>

to Complaint.</em> When an appeal is filed at the CBCA or COFC, the
contractor is required to file a formal pleading called a Complaint,
which sets forth the allegations of fact upon which the claim is
based. The Government, except for the situation discussed below,
is obligated to respond to the Complaint by admitting, denying,
or otherwise responding to the contractor’s allegations in a formal
pleading called the Answer. The contracting officer shall assist
designated litigation counsel in the drafting of the Answer by advising
whether the contractor’s allegations of fact should be admitted
or denied. If a response to an allegation in the complaint requires
information in the possession of other GSA personnel, the contracting
officer shall conduct sufficient research reasonably necessary in
order to form a belief as to the truth of the allegation. If the
information necessary to form a belief as to the truth of the allegation
is not in GSA’s possession, the contracting officer shall so advise
designated litigation counsel. In some cases, the Government may
respond to the Complaint by filing a motion to dismiss in lieu of
filing an Answer. Designated litigation counsel will advise the contracting
officer if a motion to dismiss will be filed.</p>

shall assist designated litigation counsel in responding to all
discovery requests, including providing information in response
to interrogatories, identifying and locating requested documents,
and assisting with production of witnesses for depositions.</p>
