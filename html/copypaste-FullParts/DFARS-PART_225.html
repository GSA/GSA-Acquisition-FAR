         <p class="p Revised June 5, 2020 List1">(b) The head of the contracting activity may waive a restriction on a case-by-case basis upon execution of a determination and findings that any of the following applies:</p>
         <p class="p Revised June 5, 2020 List2">(1) The restriction would cause unreasonable delays.</p>
         <p class="p Revised June 5, 2020 List2">(2) Satisfactory quality items manufactured in the United States, Australia, or Canada, or the United Kingdom are not available.</p>
         <p class="p Revised June 5, 2020 List2">(3) Application of the restriction would result in the existence of only one source for the item in the United States, Australia, or Canada, or the United Kingdom.</p>
         <p class="p Revised June 5, 2020 List2">(4) Application of the restriction is not in the national security interests of the United States.</p>
         <p class="p Revised June 5, 2020 List2">(5) Application of the restriction would adversely affect a U.S. company.</p>
         <p class="p Revised June 5, 2020 List1">(c) A restriction is waived when it would cause unreasonable costs. The cost of an item of U.S., Australian, Canadian, or United Kingdom origin is unreasonable if it exceeds 150 percent of the offered price, inclusive of duty, of items that are not of U.S., Australian, Canadian, or United Kingdom origin.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(i) An offset agreement is the contractual arrangement between the FMS customer and the U.S. defense contractor that identifies the offset obligation imposed by the FMS customer that has been accepted by the U.S. defense contractor as a condition of the FMS customer's purchase. These agreements are distinct and independent of the LOA and the FMS contract. Further information about offsets and LOAs may be found in the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) Security Assistance Management Manual (DSCA 5105.38-M), chapter 6, paragraph 6.3.9. (<em class="ph i">http://samm.dsca.mil/chapter/chapter-6</em>).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) A U.S. defense contractor may recover all costs incurred for offset agreements with a foreign government or international organization if the LOA is financed wholly with foreign government or international organization customer cash or repayable foreign military finance credits.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) The U.S. Government assumes no obligation to satisfy or administer the offset agreement or to bear any of the associated costs.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Indirect offset costs are deemed reasonable for purposes of FAR parts 15 and 31 with no further analysis necessary on the part of the contracting officer, provided that the U.S. defense contractor submits to the contracting officer a signed offset agreement or other documentation showing that the FMS customer has made the provision of an indirect offset a condition of the FMS acquisition. FMS customers are placed on notice through the LOA that indirect offset costs are deemed reasonable without any further analysis by the contracting officer.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Costs that are the subject of advance agreement under the appropriate provisions of <span class="ph FARxref">FAR part 31</span>; or where the advance understanding places a limit on the amounts of cost that will be recognized as allowable in defense contract pricing, and the agreement contemplated that it will apply only to DoD contracts for the U.S. Government's own requirement (as distinguished from contracts for FMS).</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Costs not allowable under <span class="ph FARxref">FAR Part 31</span> are not allowable in pricing FMS contracts, except as noted in paragraphs (c) and (e) of this subsection.</p>

The allowability of IR&amp;D/B&amp;P costs on contracts for FMS not wholly paid for from funds made available on a nonrepayable basis is limited to the contract's allocable share of the contractor's total IR&amp;D/B&amp;P expenditures. In pricing contracts for such FMS -</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Use the best estimate of reasonable costs in forward pricing; and</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Use actual expenditures, to the extent that they are reasonable, in determining final cost.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) Under paragraph (e)(1)(A) of Section 21 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2761), the United States must charge for administrative services to recover the estimated cost of administration of sales made under the Army Export Control Act.</p>

         <p class="p">The DTC Treaties permits the export of certain U.S. defense articles, technical data, and defense services, without U.S. export licenses or other written authorization under the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) into and within the Approved Community, as long as the exports are in support of purposes specified in the DTC Treaties.  All persons must continue to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements outside of DFARS and ITAR concerning the import of defense articles and defense services or the possession or transfer of defense articles, including, but not limited to, regulations issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives found at 27 CFR Parts 447, 478, and 479, which are unaffected by the DTC Treaties.  The Approved Community consists of U.S. entities that are registered with the Department of State and are eligible exporters, the U.S. Government, and certain governmental and commercial facilities in Australia and the United Kingdom that are approved and listed by the U.S. Government.
