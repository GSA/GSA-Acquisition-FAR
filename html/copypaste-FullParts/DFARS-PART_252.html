         <p class="p List1">(a)  <em class="ph i">Definitions</em>.  As used in this clause—</p>
         <p class="p">“Advance shipment notice” means an electronic notification used to list the contents of a shipment of goods as well as additional information relating to the shipment, such as passive radio frequency identification (RFID) or item unique identification (IUID) information, order information, product description, physical characteristics, type of packaging, marking, carrier information, and configuration of goods within the transportation equipment.</p>
         <p class="p">“Bulk commodities” means the following commodities, when shipped in rail tank cars, tanker trucks, trailers, other bulk wheeled conveyances, or pipelines:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  Sand.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Gravel.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  Bulk liquids (water, chemicals, or petroleum products).</p>

         <p class="p List2">(5)  Coal or combustibles such as firewood.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6)  Agricultural products such as seeds, grains, or animal feed.</p>
         <p class="p">“Case” means either a MIL-STD-129 defined exterior container within a palletized unit load or a MIL-STD-129 defined individual shipping container.</p>
         <p class="p">“Electronic Product Code™ (EPC)” means an identification scheme for universally identifying physical objects via RFID tags and other means.  The standardized EPC data consists of an EPC (or EPC identifier) that uniquely identifies an individual object, as well as an optional filter value when judged to be necessary to enable effective and efficient reading of the EPC tags.  In addition to this standardized data, certain classes of EPC tags will allow user-defined data.  The EPC Tag Data Standards will define the length and position of this data, without defining its content.</p>
         <p class="p">“EPCglobal®” means a subscriber-driven organization comprised of industry leaders and organizations focused on creating global standards for the adoption of passive RFID technology.</p>
         <p class="p">“Exterior container” means a MIL-STD-129 defined container, bundle, or assembly that is sufficient by reason of material, design, and construction to protect unit packs and intermediate containers and their contents during shipment and storage.  It can be a unit pack or a container with a combination of unit packs or intermediate containers.  An exterior container may or may not be used as a shipping container.</p>
         <p class="p">“Palletized unit load” means a MIL-STD-129 defined quantity of items, packed or unpacked, arranged on a pallet in a specified manner and secured, strapped, or fastened on the pallet so that the whole palletized load is handled as a single unit.  A palletized or skidded load is not considered to be a shipping container.  A loaded 463L System pallet is not considered to be a palletized unit load.  Refer to the Defense Transportation Regulation, DoD 4500.9-R, Part II, Chapter 203, for marking of 463L System pallets.</p>
         <p class="p">“Passive RFID tag” means a tag that reflects energy from the reader/interrogator or that receives and temporarily stores a small amount of energy from the reader/interrogator signal in order to generate the tag response.  The only acceptable tags are EPC Class 1 passive RFID tags that meet the EPCglobal™ Class 1 Generation 2 standard.</p>
         <p class="p">“Radio frequency identification (RFID)” means an automatic identification and data capture technology comprising one or more reader/interrogators and one or more radio frequency transponders in which data transfer is achieved by means of suitably modulated inductive or radiating electromagnetic carriers.</p>
         <p class="p">“Shipping container” means a MIL-STD-129 defined exterior container that meets carrier regulations and is of sufficient strength, by reason of material, design, and construction, to be shipped safely without further packing (e.g., wooden boxes or crates, fiber and metal drums, and corrugated and solid fiberboard boxes).</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b)(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this clause, the Contractor shall affix passive RFID tags, at the case- and palletized-unit-load packaging levels, for shipments of items that—</p>

         <p class="p">“Offset” means a benefit or obligation agreed to by a contractor and a foreign government or international organization as an inducement or condition to purchase supplies or services pursuant to a foreign military sale (FMS). There are two types of offsets: direct offsets and indirect offsets.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) A direct offset involves benefits or obligations, including supplies or services that are directly related to the item being purchased and are integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract. For example, as a condition of a foreign military sale, the contractor may require or agree to permit the customer to produce in its country certain components or subsystems of the item being sold. Generally, direct offsets must be performed within a specified period, because they are integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) An indirect offset involves benefits or obligations, including supplies or services that are not directly related to the specific item(s) being purchased and are not integral to the deliverable of the FMS contract. For example, as a condition of a foreign military sale, the contractor may agree to purchase certain manufactured products, agricultural commodities, raw materials, or services, or make an equity investment or grant of equipment required by the FMS customer, or may agree to build a school, road or other facility. Indirect offsets would also include projects that are related to the FMS contract but not purchased under said contract (e.g., a project to develop or advance a capability, technology transfer, or know-how in a foreign company). Indirect offsets may be accomplished without a clearly defined period of performance.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Exceptions from certified cost or pricing data requirements</em>.

         <p class="p">“Base labor index” means the average of the labor indices for the three months which consist of the month of bid opening (or offer submission) and the months immediately preceding and following that month.</p>
         <p class="p">“Base steel index” means the Contractor's established price (see Note 6) including all applicable extras of $________ per ____________ (see Note 1) for _______________ (see Note 2) on the date set for bid opening (or the date of submission of the offer).</p>

         <p class="p List1">(b) Each contract unit price shall be subject to revision, under the terms of this clause, to reflect changes in the cost of labor and steel. For purpose of this price revision, the proportion of the contract unit price attributable to costs of labor not otherwise included in the price of the steel item identified under the “base steel index” definition in paragraph (a) shall be _____ percent, and the proportion of the contract unit price attributable to the cost of steel shall be _____ percent. (See Note 5.)</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c)(1) Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the labor index shall be computed by dividing the total straight time earnings of the Contractor's employees in the shop identified in paragraph (a) for any given month by the total number of straight time hours worked by those employees in that month.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Any revision in a contract unit price to reflect changes in the cost of labor shall be computed solely by reference to the “base labor index” and the “current labor index.”</p>

         <p class="p List2">(4) The aggregate of the increases in any contract unit price under this contract shall not exceed ten percent of the original contract unit price.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(3) Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall make available all records used in the computation of the labor indices.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Upon receipt of the statement, the Contracting Officer will compute the revised contract unit prices and modify the contract accordingly. No modification to this contract will be made pursuant to this clause until the Contracting Officer has verified the revised established price (see Note 6).</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g)(1) In the event any item of this contract is subject to a total or partial termination for convenience, the month in which the Contractor receives notice of the termination, if prior to the month in which delivery is required, shall be considered the month in which delivery of the terminated item is required for the purposes of determining the current labor and steel indices under paragraphs (c) and (d).</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) For any item which is not terminated for convenience, the month in which delivery is required under the contract shall continue to apply for determining those indices with respect to the quantity of the non-terminated item.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) If this contract is terminated for default, any price revision shall be limited to the quantity of the item which has been delivered by the Contractor and accepted by the Government prior to receipt by the Contractor of the notice of termination.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(5)  If the direction to cease work or the removal of Government personnel results in increased costs to the Contractor, the Contractor shall not be entitled to an adjustment in the contract price or a change in the delivery or performance schedule unless the Contracting Officer later determines that the Contractor had in fact complied with the manual or schedule provisions.  If the Contractor is entitled to an equitable adjustment, it shall be made in accordance with the Changes clause of this contract.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(ii)  NOTE:  The Government Contracting Officer or authorized representative shall notify the prime Contractor of all findings concerning subcontractor safety and compliance with the manual.  The Contracting Officer or authorized representative may furnish copies to the subcontractor.  The Contractor in turn shall communicate directly with the subcontractor, substituting its name for references to “the Government”.  The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors shall also include provisions to allow direction to cease performance of the subcontract if a serious uncorrected or recurring safety deficiency potentially causes an imminent hazard to DoD personnel, property, or contract performance.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  The Contractor agrees to ensure that the subcontractor complies with all contract safety requirements.  The Contractor will determine the best method for verifying the adequacy of the subcontractor's compliance.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  The Contractor shall ensure that the subcontractor understands and agrees to the Government's right to access to the subcontractor's facilities, personnel, and safety program documentation to perform safety surveys.  The Government performs these safety surveys of subcontractor facilities solely to prevent the occurrence of any mishap which would endanger the safety of DoD personnel or otherwise adversely impact upon the Government's contractual interests.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4)  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer or authorized representative before issuing any subcontract when it involves ammunition or explosives.  If the proposed subcontract represents a change in the place of performance, the Contractor shall request approval for such change in accordance with the clause of this contract entitled “Change in Place of Performance—Ammunition and Explosives”.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(2)  “Illegal drugs,” as used in this clause, means controlled substances included in Schedules I and II, as defined by section 802(6) of Title 21 of the United States Code, the possession of which is unlawful under Chapter 13 of that Title.  The term “illegal drugs” does not mean the use of a controlled substance pursuant to a valid prescription or other uses authorized by law.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b)  The Contractor agrees to institute and maintain a program for achieving the objective of a drug-free work force.  While this clause defines criteria for such a program, contractors are encouraged to implement alternative approaches comparable to the criteria in paragraph (c) that are designed to achieve the objectives of this clause.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(4)  Provision for identifying illegal drug users, including testing on a controlled and carefully monitored basis.  Employee drug testing programs shall be established taking account of the following:</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  The Contractor shall establish a program that provides for testing for the use of illegal drugs by employees in sensitive positions.  The extent of and criteria for such testing shall be determined by the Contractor based on considerations that include the nature of the work being performed under the contract, the employee's duties, the efficient use of Contractor resources, and the risks to health, safety, or national security that could result from the failure of an employee adequately to discharge his or her position.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  In addition, the Contractor may establish a program for employee drug testing—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  When there is a reasonable suspicion that an employee uses illegal drugs; or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  When an employee has been involved in an accident or unsafe practice;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C)  As part of or as a follow-up to counseling or rehabilitation for illegal drug use;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D)  As part of a voluntary employee drug testing program.</p>

         <p class="p Ctr_SmCaps">CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SUPPORTING U.S. ARMED FORCES DEPLOYED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES (OCT 2015)</p>
         <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Definitions</em>. As used in this clause—</p>
         <p class="p">“Combatant Commander” means the commander of a unified or specified combatant command established in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 161.</p>
         <p class="p">“Contractors authorized to accompany the Force,” or “CAAF,” means contractor personnel, including all tiers of subcontractor personnel, who are authorized to accompany U.S. Armed Forces in applicable operations and have been afforded CAAF status through a letter of authorization. CAAF generally include all U.S. citizen n and third-country national employees not normally residing within the operational area whose area of performance is in the direct vicinity of U.S. Armed Forces and who routinely are collocated with the U.S. Armed Forces (especially in non-permissive environments). Personnel collocated with U.S. Armed Forces shall be afforded CAAF status through a letter of authorization. In some cases, Combatant Commander subordinate commanders may designate mission-essential host nation or local national contractor employees (e.g., interpreters) as CAAF. CAAF includes contractors previously identified as contractors deploying with the U.S. Armed Forces. CAAF status does not apply to contractor personnel in support of applicable operations within the boundaries and territories of the United States.</p>
         <p class="p">“Designated operational area” means a geographic area designated by the combatant commander or subordinate joint force commander for the conduct or support of specified military operations.</p>
         <p class="p">“Designated reception site” means the designated place for the reception, staging, integration, and onward movement of contractors deploying during a contingency. The designated reception site includes assigned joint reception centers and other Service or private reception sites.</p>
         <p class="p">“Law of war” means that part of international law that regulates the conduct of armed hostilities. The law of war encompasses all international law for the conduct of hostilities binding on the United States or its individual citizens, including treaties and international agreements to which the United States is a party, and applicable customary international law.</p>
         <p class="p">“Non-CAAF” means personnel who are not designated as CAAF, such as local national (LN) employees and non-LN employees who are permanent residents in the operational area or third-country nationals not routinely residing with U.S. Armed Forces (and third-country national expatriates who are permanent residents in the operational area) who perform support functions away from the close proximity of, and do not reside with, U.S. Armed Forces. Government-furnished support to non-CAAF is typically limited to force protection, emergency medical care, and basic human needs (e.g., bottled water, latrine facilities, security, and food when necessary) when performing their jobs in the direct vicinity of U.S. Armed Forces. Non-CAAF status does not apply to contractor personnel in support of applicable operations within the boundaries and territories of the United States.</p>
         <p class="p Footnotetext">“Subordinate joint force commander” means a sub-unified commander or joint task force commander.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">General</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) This clause applies to both CAAF and non-CAAF when performing in a designated operational area outside the United States to support U.S. Armed Forces deployed outside the United States in—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Contingency operations;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Peace operations, consistent with Joint Publication 3-07.3; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Other military operations or military exercises, when designated by the Combatant Commander or as directed by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Contract performance in support of U.S. Armed Forces deployed outside the United States may require work in dangerous or austere conditions. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Contractor accepts the risks associated with required contract performance in such operations.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) When authorized in accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause to carry arms for personal protection, Contractor personnel are only authorized to use force for individual self-defense.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Unless immune from host nation jurisdiction by virtue of an international agreement or international law, inappropriate use of force by contractor personnel supporting the U.S. Armed Forces can subject such personnel to United States or host nation prosecution and civil liability (see paragraphs (d) and (j)(3) of this clause).</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Service performed by Contractor personnel subject to this clause is not active duty or service under 38 U.S.C. 106 note.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Support</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)(i) The Combatant Commander will develop a security plan for protection of Contractor personnel in locations where there is not sufficient or legitimate civil authority, when the Combatant Commander decides it is in the interests of the Government to provide security because—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) The Contractor cannot obtain effective security services;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Effective security services are unavailable at a reasonable cost; or</p>

         <p class="p List3">(ii) In appropriate cases, the Combatant Commander may provide security through military means, commensurate with the level of security provided DoD civilians.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)(i) Generally, CAAF will be afforded emergency medical and dental care if injured while supporting applicable operations. Additionally, non-CAAF employees who are injured while in the vicinity of U. S. Armed Forces will normally receive emergency medical and dental care. Emergency medical and dental care includes medical care situations in which life, limb, or eyesight is jeopardized. Examples of emergency medical and dental care include examination and initial treatment of victims of sexual assault; refills of prescriptions for life-dependent drugs; repair of broken bones, lacerations, infections; and traumatic injuries to the dentition. Hospitalization will be limited to stabilization and short-term medical treatment with an emphasis on return to duty or placement in the patient movement system.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(7)  “Developed” means that an item, component, or process exists and is workable.  Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or the process practiced.  Workability is generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended.  Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state of the art.  To be considered “developed,” the item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component, or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(8)  “Developed exclusively at private expense” means development was accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(10)  “Developed with mixed funding” means development was accomplished partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged directly to a government contract.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(11)  “Form, fit, and function data” means technical data that describes the required overall physical, functional, and performance characteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable items.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(12)  “Government purpose” means any activity in which the United States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements with international or multi-national defense organizations, or sales or transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or international organizations.

         <p class="p List3">(i)  The reproduction, release, disclosure, or use is—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or</p>

         <p class="p List3">(i) (Applicable to technical data other than computer software documentation.) An item, component, or process, exists and is workable. Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or the process practiced. Workability is generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state of the art. To be considered “developed,” the item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) A computer program has been successfully operated in a computer and tested to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons skilled in the art that the program can reasonably be expected to perform its intended purpose;</p>

         <p class="p List3">(i) Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest practicable level.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional development costs necessary to complete development shall not be considered when determining whether development was at government, private, or mixed expense.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(10) <em class="ph i">Developed exclusively with government funds</em> means development was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(11) <em class="ph i">Developed with mixed funding</em> means development was accomplished partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged directly to a government contract.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(12) <em class="ph i">Form, fit, and function data</em> means technical data that describe the required overall physical, functional, and performance characteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable items.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(15) “Limited rights” means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, in whole or in part, within the Government. The Government may not, without the written permission of the party asserting limited rights, release or disclose the technical data outside the Government, use the technical data for manufacture, or authorize the technical data to be used by another party, except that the Government may reproduce, release, or disclose such data or authorize the use or reproduction of the data by persons outside the Government if -</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The reproduction, release, disclosure, or use is -</p>

         <p class="p List2">(18) “Restricted rights” apply only to noncommercial computer software and mean the Government's rights to -</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Use a computer program with one computer at one time. The program may not be accessed by more than one terminal or central processing unit or time shared unless otherwise permitted by this contract;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Transfer a computer program to another Government agency without the further permission of the Contractor if the transferor destroys all copies of the program and related computer software documentation in its possession and notifies the licensor of the transfer.

         <p class="p List4">(A) The Government notifies the party which has granted restricted rights that a release or disclosure to particular contractors or subcontractors was made;</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Such contractors or subcontractors are subject to the non-disclosure agreement at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS-PART_227.html#DFARS-227.7103-7">227.7103-7</a> of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement or are Government contractors receiving access to the software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#DFARS-252.227-7025">252.227-7025</a>, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends;</p>

         <p class="p List2">(2) Whenever any noncommercial technical data or computer software is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The Contractor shall use the Technical Data - Commercial Items clause of this contract to obtain technical data pertaining to commercial items, components, or processes.

         <p class="p List2">(3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for technical data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such technical data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data or computer software from their subcontractors or suppliers.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data or computer software as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(1) As used in this clause, unless otherwise specifically indicated, the term “Contractor” means the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Other terms used in this clause are defined in the Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation clause of this contract.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Justification.</em> The Contractor shall maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any markings that assert restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release, or disclose computer software delivered or required to be delivered under this contract and shall be prepared to furnish to the Contracting Officer a written justification for such restrictive markings in response to a request for information under paragraph (d) or a challenge under paragraph (f) of this clause.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) <em class="ph i">Direct contact with subcontractors or suppliers</em>. The Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer may transact matters under this clause directly with subcontractors or suppliers at any tier who assert restrictions on the Government's right to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software. Neither this clause, nor any action taken by the Government under this clause, creates or implies privity of contract between the Government and the Contractor's subcontractors or suppliers.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) <em class="ph i">Requests for information</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor to provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor's asserted restrictions. Such information shall be based upon the records required by this clause or other information reasonably available to the Contractor.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Based upon the information provided, if the—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Contractor agrees that an asserted restriction is not valid, the Contracting Officer may—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Strike or correct the unjustified marking at the Contractor's expense; or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) Return the computer software to the Contractor for correction at the Contractor's expense. If the Contractor fails to correct or strike the unjustified restriction and return the corrected software to the Contracting Officer within sixty (60) days following receipt of the software, the Contracting Officer may correct or strike the markings at that Contractor's expense.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Contracting Officer concludes that the asserted restriction is appropriate for this contract, the Contracting Officer shall so notify the Contractor in writing.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The Contractor's failure to provide a timely response to a Contracting Officer's request for information or failure to provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate an asserted restriction shall constitute reasonable grounds for questioning the validity of an asserted restriction.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) <em class="ph i">Government right to challenge and validate asserted restrictions</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The Government, when there are reasonable grounds to do so, has the right to review and challenge the validity of any restrictions asserted by the Contractor on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software delivered, to be delivered under this contract, or otherwise provided to the Government in the performance of this contract. Except for software that is publicly available, has been furnished to the Government without restrictions, or has been otherwise made available without restrictions, the Government may exercise this right only within three years after the date(s) the software is delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government, or three years following final payment under this contract, whichever is later.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The absence of a challenge to an asserted restriction shall not constitute validation under this clause. Only a Contracting Officer's final decision or actions of an agency Board of Contract Appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute validation of the restriction.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) <em class="ph i">Challenge procedures</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) A challenge must be in writing and shall—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted restriction;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Require the Contractor to respond within sixty (60) days;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Require the Contractor to provide justification for the assertion based upon records kept in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause and such other documentation that are reasonably available to the Contractor, in sufficient detail to enable the Contracting Officer to determine the validity of the asserted restrictions; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) State that a Contracting Officer's final decision, during the three-year period preceding this challenge, or action of a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals that sustained the validity of an identical assertion made by the Contractor (or a licensee) shall serve as justification for the asserted restriction.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The Contracting Officer shall extend the time for response if the Contractor submits a written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The Contracting Officer may request additional supporting documentation if, in the Contracting Officer’s opinion, the Contractor's explanation does not provide sufficient evidence to justify the validity of the asserted restrictions. The Contractor agrees to promptly respond to the Contracting Officer's request for additional supporting documentation.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Notwithstanding challenge by the Contracting Officer, the parties may agree on the disposition of an asserted restriction at any time prior to a Contracting Officer's final decision or, if the Contractor has appealed that decision, filed suit, or provided notice of an intent to file suit, at any time prior to a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) If the Contractor fails to respond to the Contracting Officer's request for information or additional information under paragraph (f)(1) of this clause, the Contracting Officer shall issue a final decision, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing any available information pertaining to the validity of an asserted restriction, determines that the asserted restriction has—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Not been justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue promptly a final decision, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, denying the validity of the asserted restriction; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Been justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue promptly a final decision, in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract, validating the asserted restriction.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7) A Contractor receiving challenges to the same asserted restriction(s) from more than one Contracting Officer shall notify each Contracting Officer of the other challenges. The notice shall also state which Contracting Officer initiated the first in time unanswered challenge. The Contracting Officer who initiated the first in time unanswered challenge, after consultation with the other Contracting Officers who have challenged the restrictions and the Contractor, shall formulate and distribute a schedule that provides the Contractor a reasonable opportunity for responding to each challenge.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) <em class="ph i">Contractor appeal</em>—<em class="ph i">Government obligation</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The Government agrees that, notwithstanding a Contracting Officer's final decision denying the validity of an asserted restriction and except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this clause, it will honor the asserted restriction—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) For a period of ninety (90) days from the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision to allow the Contractor to appeal to the appropriate Board of Contract Appeals or to file suit in an appropriate court;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) For a period of one year from the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision if, within the first ninety (90) days following the Contracting Officer's final decision, the Contractor has provided notice of an intent to file suit in an appropriate court; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Until final disposition by the appropriate Board of Contract Appeals or court of competent jurisdiction, if the Contractor has:</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) appealed to the Board of Contract Appeals or filed suit an appropriate court within ninety (90) days; or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) submitted, within ninety (90) days, a notice of intent to file suit in an appropriate court and filed suit within one year.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The Contractor agrees that the Government may strike, correct, or ignore the restrictive markings if the Contractor fails to—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Appeal to a Board of Contract Appeals within ninety (90) days from the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) File suit in an appropriate court within ninety (90) days from such date; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) File suit within one year after the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision if the Contractor had provided notice of intent to file suit within ninety (90) days following the date of the Contracting Officer's final decision.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The agency head, on a nondelegable basis, may determine that urgent or compelling circumstances do not permit awaiting the filing of suit in an appropriate court, or the rendering of a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals. In that event, the agency head shall notify the Contractor of the urgent or compelling circumstances. Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1) of this clause, the Contractor agrees that the agency may use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software marked with (i) government purpose legends for any purpose, and authorize others to do so; or (ii) restricted or special license rights for government purposes only. The Government agrees not to release or disclose such software unless, prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and non-disclosure agreement at <span class="ph DFARxref">

         <p class="p List1">(h) <em class="ph i">Final disposition of appeal or suit</em>. If the Contractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is:</p>

         <p class="p List3">(ii) If the asserted restriction is found not to be substantially justified, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for payment of the cost to the Government of reviewing the asserted restriction and the fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Government in challenging the restriction, unless special circumstances would make such payment unjust.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(2)  The Contracting Officer shall extend the time for response as appropriate if the Contractor or subcontractor submits a written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  The Contractor's or subcontractor's written response shall be considered a claim within the meaning of 41 U.S.C. 7101, Contract Disputes, and shall be certified in the form prescribed at 33.207 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, regardless of dollar amount. </p>
         <p class="p List2">(4)  A Contractor or subcontractor receiving challenges to the same restrictive markings from more than one Contracting Officer shall notify each Contracting Officer of the existence of more than one challenge.  The notice shall also state which Contracting Officer initiated the first in time unanswered challenge.  The Contracting Officer initiating the first in time unanswered challenge after consultation with the Contractor or subcontractor and the other Contracting Officers, shall formulate and distribute a schedule for responding to each of the challenge notices to all interested parties.  The schedule shall afford the Contractor or subcontractor an opportunity to respond to each challenge notice.  All parties will be bound by this schedule.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f)  <em class="ph i">Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor fails to respond.  </em>Upon a failure of a Contractor or subcontractor to submit any response to the challenge notice the Contracting Officer will issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause and the Disputes clause of this contract pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction.  This final decision shall be issued as soon as possible after the expiration of the time period of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) or (e)(2) of this clause.  Following issuance of the final decision, the Contracting Officer will comply with the procedures in paragraphs (g)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this clause.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g)  <em class="ph i">Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor responds.</em>
         </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  If the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor or subcontractor has justified the validity of the restrictive marking, the Contracting Officer shall issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor sustaining the validity of the restrictive marking, and stating that the Government will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking.  This final decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Contractor's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor that the Government will require.  The notification of a longer period for issuance of a final decision will be made within sixty (60) days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)(i)  If the Contracting Officer determines that the validity of the restrictive marking is not justified, the Contracting Officer shall issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract.  Notwithstanding paragraph (e) of the Disputes clause, the final decision shall be issued within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Contractor's or subcontractor's response to the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor of the longer period that the Government will require.  The notification of a longer period for issuance of a final decision will be made within sixty (60) days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking for a period of ninety (90) days from the issuance of the Contracting Officer's final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause.  The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that, if it intends to file suit in the United States Claims Court it will provide a notice of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer within ninety (90) days from the issuance of the Contracting Officer's final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause.  If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to appeal, file suit, or provide a notice of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer within the ninety (90)-day period, the Government may cancel or ignore the restrictive markings, and the failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to take the required action constitutes agreement with such Government action.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking where a notice of intent to file suit in the United States Claims Court is provided to the Contracting Officer within ninety (90) days from the issuance of the final decision under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this clause.  The Government will no longer be bound, and the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Government may strike or ignore the restrictive markings, if the Contractor or subcontractor fails to file its suit within one (1) year after issuance of the final decision.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a nondelegable basis, that urgent or compelling circumstances will not permit waiting for the filing of a suit in the United States Claims Court, the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the agency may, following notice to the Contractor or subcontractor, authorize release or disclosure of the technical data.  Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its restrictive markings are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  The Government agrees that it will be bound by the restrictive marking where an appeal or suit is filed pursuant to the Contract Disputes statute until final disposition by an agency Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Claims Court.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a nondelegable basis, following notice to the Contractor that urgent or compelling circumstances will not permit awaiting the decision by such Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Claims Court, the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the agency may authorize release or disclosure of the technical data.  Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor's or subcontractor's right to damages against the United States where its restrictive markings are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(h)  <em class="ph i">Final disposition of appeal or suit.</em>
         </p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  If the Contractor or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is sustained—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  The restrictive marking on the technical data shall be cancelled, corrected or ignored; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  If the restrictive marking is found not to be substantially justified, the Contractor or subcontractor, as appropriate, shall be liable to the Government for payment of the cost to the Government of reviewing the restrictive marking and the fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Government in challenging the marking, unless special circumstances would make such payment unjust.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  If the Contractor or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer's decision is not sustained—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  The Government shall continue to be bound by the restrictive marking; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  The Government shall be liable to the Contractor or subcontractor for payment of fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Contractor or subcontractor in defending the marking, if the challenge by the Government is found not to have been made in good faith.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  <em class="ph i">Duration of right to challenge.</em>  The Government may review the validity of any restriction on technical data, delivered or to be delivered under a contract, asserted by the Contractor or subcontractor.  During the period within three (3) years of final payment on a contract or within three (3) years of delivery of the technical data to the Government, whichever is later, the Contracting Officer may review and make a written determination to challenge the restriction.  The Government may, however, challenge a restriction on the release, disclosure or use of technical data at any time if such technical data—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  Is publicly available;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Has been furnished to the United States without restriction; or</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  Has been otherwise made available without restriction.  Only the Contracting Officer's final decision resolving a formal challenge by sustaining the validity of a restrictive marking constitutes “validation” as addressed in 10 U.S.C. 2321.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(j)  <em class="ph i">Decision not to challenge</em>.  A decision by the Government, or a determination by the Contracting Officer, to not challenge the restrictive marking or asserted restriction shall not constitute “validation.”</p>
         <p class="p List1">(k)  <em class="ph i">Privity of contract.</em>  The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Contracting Officer may transact matters under this clause directly with subcontractors at any tier that assert restrictive markings.  However, this clause neither creates nor implies privity of contract between the Government and subcontractors.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(l)  <em class="ph i">Flowdown.</em>  The Contractor or subcontractor agrees to insert this clause in contractual instruments, including subcontracts and other contractual instruments for commercial items, with its subcontractors or suppliers at any tier requiring the delivery of technical data.</p>

However, in any case where publication, on sale, or public use has initiated the 1-year statutory period during which valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States, the agency may shorten the period of election of title to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  The Contractor shall—</p>

         <p class="p List3">(ii) Any dispute as to the timeliness of the Contractor's action or the equitable adjustment shall be considered a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.</p>

         <p class="p List2">(2) Is sustained during flight if either the flight or the flight crew members have not been approved in advance of any flight writing by the Government Flight Representative, who has been authorized in accordance with the combined regulation/instruction entitled “Contractor’s Flight and Ground Operations”;</p>

(This exclusion does not apply to Government-furnished property if damage consists of reasonable wear and tear or deterioration, or results from inherent vice, e.g., a known condition or design defect, in the property); or</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) Is sustained while the aircraft is being worked on and is a direct result of the work unless such damage, loss, or destruction would be covered by insurance which would have been maintained by the Contractor, but for the Government's assumption of risk.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) <em class="ph i">Contractor’s share of loss and Contractor’s deductible under the</em> Government’s self-insurance.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The Contractor assumes the risk of loss and shall be responsible for the Contractor’s share of loss under the Government’s self-insurance. That share is the lesser of—</p>

         <p class="p List2">(2) If the Government elects to require that the aircraft be replaced or restored by the Contractor to its condition immediately prior to the damage, the equitable adjustment in the price authorized by paragraph (j) of this clause shall not include the dollar amount of the risk assumed by the Contractor.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) In the event the Government does not elect repair or replacement, the Contractor agrees to credit the contract price or pay the Government, as directed by the Contracting Officer, the lesser of—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) $100,000;</p>

         <p class="p List1">(a)  “Direct Contractor,” as used in this clause, means an individual, company, or entity with whom an agency of the United States Department of Defense has executed a written agreement that allows duty-free import of equipment, materials, and supplies into Spain for the construction, development, maintenance, and operation of Spanish-American installations and facilities.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b)  The Contractor is hereby designated as a Direct Contractor under the provisions of Complementary Agreement 5, articles 11, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the Agreement on Friendship, Defense and Cooperation between the United States Government and the Kingdom of Spain, dated July 2, 1982.  The Agreement relates to contracts to be performed in whole or part in Spain, the provisions of which are hereby incorporated into and made a part of this contract by reference.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c)  The Contractor shall apply to the appropriate Spanish authorities for approval of status as a Direct Contractor in order to complete duty-free import of non-Spanish equipment, materials, and supplies represented as necessary for contract performance by the Contracting Officer.  Orders for equipment, materials, and supplies placed prior to official notification of such approval shall be at the Contractor’s own risk.  The Contractor must submit its documentation in sufficient time to permit processing by the appropriate United States and Spanish Government agencies prior to the arrival of the equipment, materials, or supplies in Spain.  Seasonal variations in processing times are common, and the Contractor should program its projects accordingly.  Any delay or expense arising directly or indirectly from this process shall not excuse untimely performance (except as expressly allowed in other provisions of this contract), constitute a direct or constructive change, or otherwise provide a basis for additional compensation or adjustment of any kind. </p>
         <p class="p List1">(d)  To ensure that all duty-free imports are properly accounted for, exported, or disposed of, in accordance with Spanish law, the Contractor shall obtain a written bank letter of guaranty payable to the Treasurer of the United States, or such other authority as may be designated by the Contracting Officer, in the amount set forth in paragraph (g) of this clause, prior to effecting any duty-free imports for the performance of this contract.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e)  If the Contractor fails to obtain the required guaranty, the Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer may withhold a portion of the contract payments in order to establish a fund in the amount set forth in paragraph (g) of this clause.  The fund shall be used for the payment of import taxes in the event that the Contractor fails to properly account for, export, or dispose of equipment, materials, or supplies imported on a duty-free basis.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f)  The amount of the bank letter of guaranty or size of the fund required under paragraph (d) or (e) of this clause normally shall be 5 percent of the contract value.  However, if the Contractor demonstrates to the Contracting Officer’s satisfaction that the amount retained by the United States Government or guaranteed by the bank is excessive, the amount shall be reduced to an amount commensurate with contingent import tax and duty-free liability.  This bank guaranty or fund shall not be released to the Contractor until the Spanish General Directorate of Customs verifies the accounting, export, or disposition of the equipment, material, or supplies imported on a duty-free basis.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g)  The amount required under paragraph (d), (e), or (f) of this clause is <em class="ph i">(Contracting Officer insert amount at time of contract award) </em>.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(a)  Contract line item(s)  <em class="ph i">[Contracting Officer insert after negotiations]</em> is/are incrementally funded.  For this/these item(s), the sum of $ <em class="ph i">[Contracting Officer insert after negotiations] </em> of the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract.  An allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (j) of this clause.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b)  For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government’s convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract.  The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point.  The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.”  As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for those item(s).</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c)  Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor’s best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s).  The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date.  The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for a subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause or otherwise agreed to by the parties.  If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor’s notification, or by an agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.”</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d)  When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds.  The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e)  If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both.  Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled “Disputes.”</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f)  The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g)  The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled “Default.”  The provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause.  This clause no longer applies once the contract is fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(h)  Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.”</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Definitions.</em> As used in this clause——</p>
         <p class="p">“Acceptable earned value management system” means an earned value management system that generally complies with system criteria in paragraph (b) of this clause.</p>
         <p class="p">“Earned value management system” means an earned value management system that complies with the earned value management system guidelines in the ANSI/EIA-748.</p>
         <p class="p">“Significant deficiency” means a shortcoming in the system that materially affects the ability of officials of the Department of Defense to rely upon information produced by the system that is needed for management purposes.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">System criteria</em>. In the performance of this contract, the Contractor shall use—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) An Earned Value Management System (EVMS) that complies with the EVMS guidelines in the American National Standards Institute/Electronic Industries Alliance Standard 748, Earned Value Management Systems (ANSI/EIA-748); and</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Management procedures that provide for generation of timely, reliable, and verifiable information for the Contract Performance Report (CPR) and the Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) required by the CPR and IMS data items of this contract.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) If this contract has a value of $50 million or more, the Contractor shall use an EVMS that has been determined to be acceptable by the Cognizant Federal Agency (CFA). If, at the time of award, the Contractor’s EVMS has not been determined by the CFA to be in compliance with the EVMS guidelines as stated in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the Contractor shall apply its current system to the contract and shall take necessary actions to meet the milestones in the Contractor’s EVMS plan.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) If this contract has a value of less than $50 million, the Government will not make a formal determination that the Contractor’s EVMS complies with the EVMS guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748 with respect to the contract. The use of the Contractor’s EVMS for this contract does not imply a Government determination of the Contractor’s compliance with the EVMS guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748 for application to future contracts. The Government will allow the use of a Contractor’s EVMS that has been formally reviewed and determined by the CFA to be in compliance with the EVMS guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) The Contractor shall submit notification of any proposed substantive changes to the EVMS procedures and the impact of those changes to the CFA. If this contract has a value of $50 million or more, unless a waiver is granted by the CFA, any EVMS changes proposed by the Contractor require approval of the CFA prior to implementation. The CFA will advise the Contractor of the acceptability of such changes as soon as practicable (generally within 30 calendar days) after receipt of the Contractor’s notice of proposed changes. If the CFA waives the advance approval requirements, the Contractor shall disclose EVMS changes to the CFA at least 14 calendar days prior to the effective date of implementation.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) The Government will schedule integrated baseline reviews as early as practicable, and the review process will be conducted not later than 180 calendar days after—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Contract award;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The exercise of significant contract options; and</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The incorporation of major modifications.</p>
         <p class="p">During such reviews, the Government and the Contractor will jointly assess the Contractor’s baseline to be used for performance measurement to ensure complete coverage of the statement of work, logical scheduling of the work activities, adequate resourcing, and identification of inherent risks.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(g) The Contractor shall provide access to all pertinent records and data requested by the Contracting Officer or duly authorized representative as necessary to permit Government surveillance to ensure that the EVMS complies, and continues to comply, with the performance criteria referenced in paragraph (b) of this clause.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(h) When indicated by contract performance, the Contractor shall submit a request for approval to initiate an over-target baseline or over-target schedule to the Contracting Officer. The request shall include a top-level projection of cost and/or schedule growth, a determination of whether or not performance variances will be retained, and a schedule of implementation for the rebaselining. The Government will acknowledge receipt of the request in a timely manner (generally within 30 calendar days).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) <em class="ph i">Significant deficiencies</em>. (1) The Contracting Officer will provide an initial determination to the Contractor, in writing, of any significant deficiencies. The initial determination will describe the deficiency in sufficient detail to allow the Contractor to understand the deficiency.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The Contractor shall respond within 30 days to a written initial determination from the Contracting Officer that identifies significant deficiencies in the Contractor's EVMS. If the Contractor disagrees with the initial determination, the Contractor shall state, in writing, its rationale for disagreeing.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The Contracting Officer will evaluate the Contractor's response and notify the Contractor, in writing, of the Contracting Officer’s final determination concerning—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Remaining significant deficiencies;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The adequacy of any proposed or completed corrective action;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) System noncompliance, when the Contractor’s existing EVMS fails to comply with the earned value management system guidelines in the ANSI/EIA-748; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) System disapproval, if initial EVMS validation is not successfully completed within the time frame approved by the Contracting Officer, or if the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor's earned value management system contains one or more significant deficiencies in high-risk guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748 standards (guidelines 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 21, 23, 26, 27, 28, 30, or 32). When the Contracting Officer determines that the existing earned value management system contains one or more significant deficiencies in one or more of the remaining 16 guidelines in ANSI/EIA-748 standards, the Contracting Officer will use discretion to disapprove the system based on input received from functional specialists and the auditor.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) If the Contractor receives the Contracting Officer’s final determination of significant deficiencies, the Contractor shall, within 45 days of receipt of the final determination, either correct the significant deficiencies or submit an acceptable corrective action plan showing milestones and actions to eliminate the significant deficiencies.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(j) <em class="ph i">Withholding payments</em>. If the Contracting Officer makes a final determination to disapprove the Contractor’s EVMS, and the contract includes the clause at <span class="ph DFARxref">

For example, this could include the use of human organs, tissue, and body fluids from individually identifiable living human subjects as well as graphic, written, or recorded information derived from individually identifiable living human subjects.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4)  “Institution” means any public or private entity or agency (32 CFR 219.102(b)). </p>
         <p class="p List2">(5)  “Institutional Review Board (IRB)” means a board established for the purposes expressed in 32 CFR Part 219 (32 CFR 219.102(g)).</p>

         <p class="p List2">(7)  “Research” means a systematic investigation, including research, development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.  Activities that meet this definition constitute research for purposes of 32 CFR Part 219, whether or not they are conducted or supported under a program that is considered research for other purposes.  For example, some demonstration and service programs may include research activities (32 CFR 219.102(d)).</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b)  The Contractor shall oversee the execution of the research to ensure compliance with this clause.  The Contractor shall comply fully with 32 CFR Part 219 and DoD Directive 3216.02, applicable DoD component policies, 10 U.S.C. 980, and, when applicable, Food and Drug Administration policies and regulations.  </p>

         <p class="p List2">(1)  The Contractor furnishes to the HRPO, with a copy to the Contracting Officer, an assurance of compliance and IRB approval and receives notification from the Contracting Officer that the HRPO has approved the assurance as appropriate for the research under the Statement of Work and also that the HRPO has reviewed the protocol and accepted the IRB approval for compliance with the DoD component policies.  The Contractor may furnish evidence of an existing assurance of compliance for acceptance by the HRPO, if an appropriate assurance has been approved in connection with previous research.  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer immediately of any suspensions or terminations of the assurance. </p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  The Contractor furnishes to the HRPO, with a copy to the Contracting Officer, a determination that the human research proposed meets exemption criteria in 32 CFR 219.101(b) and receives written notification from the Contracting Officer that the exemption is determined acceptable.  The determination shall include citation of the exemption category under 32 CFR 219.101(b) and a rationale statement.  In the event of a disagreement regarding the Contractor’s furnished exemption determination, the HRPO retains final judgment on what research activities or classes of research are covered or are exempt under the contract. </p>
         <p class="p List1">(d)  DoD staff, consultants, and advisory groups may independently review and inspect the Contractor’s research and research procedures involving human subjects and, based on such findings, DoD may prohibit research that presents unacceptable hazards or otherwise fails to comply with DoD procedures.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e)  Failure of the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this clause will result in the issuance of a stop-work order under Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.242-15 to immediately suspend, in whole or in part, work and further payment under this contract, or will result in other issuance of suspension of work and further payment for as long as determined necessary at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  </p>

         <p class="p List1">(a)  <em class="ph i">Definitions.  </em>As used in this clause—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  “Landing areas” means—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  The primary surfaces, comprising the surface of the runway, runway shoulders, and lateral safety zones.  The length of each primary surface is the same as the runway length.  The width of each primary surface is 2,000 feet (1,000 feet on each side of the runway centerline);</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  The “clear zone” beyond the ends of each runway, i.e., the extension of the primary surface for a distance of 1,000 feet beyond each end of each runway;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  All taxiways, plus the lateral clearance zones along each side for the length of the taxiways (the outer edge of each lateral clearance zone is laterally 250 feet from the far or opposite edge of the taxiway, e.g., a 75-foot-wide taxiway would have a combined width of taxiway and lateral clearance zones of 425 feet); and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  All aircraft parking aprons, plus the area 125 feet in width extending beyond each edge all around the aprons.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  “Safety precaution areas” means those portions of approach-departure clearance zones and transitional zones where placement of objects incident to contract performance might result in vertical projections at or above the approach-departure clearance, or the transitional surface.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  The “approach-departure clearance surface” is an extension of the primary surface and the clear zone at each end of each runway, for a distance of 50,000 feet, first along an inclined (glide angle) and then along a horizontal plane, both flaring symmetrically about the runway centerline extended.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  The inclined plane (glide angle) begins in the clear zone 200 feet past the end of the runway (and primary surface) at the same elevation as the end of the runway.  It continues upward at a slope of 50:1 (1 foot vertically for each 50 feet horizontally) to an elevation of 500 feet above the established airfield elevation.  At that point the plane becomes horizontal, continuing at that same uniform elevation to a point 50,000 feet longitudinally from the beginning of the inclined plane (glide angle) and ending there.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  The width of the surface at the beginning of the inclined plane (glide angle) is the same as the width of the clear zone.  It then flares uniformly, reaching the maximum width of 16,000 feet at the end.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  The “approach-departure clearance zone” is the ground area under the approach-departure clearance surface.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  The “transitional surface” is a sideways extension of all primary surfaces, clear zones, and approach-departure clearance surfaces along inclined planes.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A)  The inclined plane in each case begins at the edge of the surface.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)  The slope of the incline plane is 7:1 (1 foot vertically for each 7 feet horizontally).  It continues to the point of intersection with the—</p>
         <p class="p List6">
            <em class="ph i">(1)</em>  Inner horizontal surface (which is the horizontal plane 150 feet above the established airfield elevation); or</p>

The Government will not reimburse the Contractor for any actual nonrecoverable costs incurred after notice of award, but prior to execution of the order.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c)  When feasible, the Contractor shall reuse cancelled or terminated facilities or equipment to minimize the charges to the Government.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d)  If at any time the Government requires that telecommunications facilities or equipment be relocated within the Contractor's service area, the Government will have the option of paying the costs of relocating the facilities or equipment in lieu of paying any termination or cancellation charge under this clause. The basic cancellation liability or basic termination liability applicable to the facilities or equipment in their former location shall continue to apply to the facilities and equipment in their new location. Monthly recurring charges shall continue to be paid during the period.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e)  When there is another requirement or foreseeable reuse in place of cancelled or terminated facilities or equipment, no charge shall apply and the basic cancellation liability or basic termination liability shall be appropriately reduced.

         <p class="p List1">(f)  The amount of the Government's liability upon cancellation or termination of any of the services ordered under this agreement/contract will be determined under applicable tariffs governing cancellation and termination charges which—</p>

         <p class="p List2">(1)  The Contractor agrees to provide the Contracting Officer, in such reasonable detail as the Contracting Officer may require, inventory schedules covering all items of property or facilities in the Contractor's possession, the cost of which is included in the Basic Cancellation or Termination Liability for which the Contractor has no foreseeable reuse.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  The Contractor shall use its best efforts to sell property or facilities when the Contractor has no foreseeable reuse or when the Government has not exercised its option to take title under the Title to Telecommunications Facilities and Equipment clause of this agreement/contract.  The Contractor shall apply any proceeds of the sale to reduce any payments by the Government to the Contractor under a cancellation or termination settlement.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3)  The Contractor shall record actual nonrecoverable costs under established accounting procedures prescribed by the cognizant governmental regulatory authority or, if no such procedures have been prescribed, under generally accepted accounting procedures applicable to the provision of telecommunication services for public use.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4)  The net salvage value shall be deducted from the Contractor’s installed cost.  In determining net salvage value, the Contractor shall consider the foreseeable reuse of the facilities and equipment by the Contractor.  The Contractor shall make allowance for the cost of dismantling, removal, reconditioning, and disposal of the facilities and equipment when necessary either for the sale of facilities or their reuse by the Contractor in another location.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5)  Upon termination of services, the Government will reimburse the Contractor for the nonrecoverable cost less such costs amortized to the date services are terminated and establish the liability period as mutually agreed to but not to exceed ten years.  In the case of either a cancellation or a termination, the Government’s presumed maximum liability will be capped by the unpaid non-recurring charges and the monthly recurring charges set out in the contract/agreement.  The presumed maximum liability for monthly recurring charges shall be capped at monthly recurring charges for the minimum service period and any required notice period.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6)  When the basic cancellation liability or basic termination liability established by the CSA or other contractual document is based on estimated costs, the Contractor agrees to settle on the basis of actual cost at the time of cancellation or termination.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(7)  The Contractor agrees that, if after settlement but within the termination liability period of the services, should the Contractor make reuse of equipment or facilities which were treated as nonreusable or nonsalvable in the settlement, the Contractor shall reimburse the Government for the value of the equipment or facilities.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(8)  The Contractor agrees to exclude—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  Any costs which are not included in determining cancellation and termination charges under the Contractor's standard practices or procedures; and</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  Charges not ordinarily made by the Contractor for similar facilities or equipment, furnished under similar circumstances.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(i)  The Government may, under such terms and conditions as it may prescribe, make partial payments and payments on account against costs incurred by the Contractor in connection with the cancelled or terminated portion of this agreement/contract.  The Government may make these payments if the Contracting Officer determines that the total of the payments is within the amount the Contractor is entitled.  If the total of the payments is in excess of the amount finally agreed or determined to be due under this clause, the Contractor shall pay the excess to the Government upon demand.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(ii) The costing methodology may be standard or actual cost, or any of the inventory costing methods in 48 CFR 9904.411-50(b). The Contractor shall maintain consistency across all contract and customer types, and from accounting period to accounting period for initial charging and transfer charging.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) The system should transfer parts and associated costs within the same billing period. In the few instances where this may not be appropriate, the Contractor may accomplish the material transaction using a loan/pay-back technique. The “loan/pay-back technique” means that the physical part is moved temporarily from the contract, but the cost of the part remains on the contract. The procedures for the loan/pay-back technique must be approved by the ACO. When the technique is used, the Contractor shall have controls to ensure—</p>

         <p class="p List1">(c)  General.  The Contractor shall establish and maintain acceptable business systems in accordance with the terms and conditions of this contract.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d)  Significant deficiencies.  (1)  The Contractor shall respond, in writing, within 30 days to an initial determination that there are one or more significant deficiencies in one or more of the Contractor’s business systems.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  The Contracting Officer will evaluate the Contractor's response and notify the Contractor, in writing, of the final determination as to whether the Contractor’s business system contains significant deficiencies.  If the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor’s business system contains significant deficiencies, the final determination will include a notice to withhold payments.</p>

(1)  If the Contracting Officer issues the final determination with a notice to withhold payments for significant deficiencies in a contractor business system required under this contract, the Contracting Officer will withhold five percent of amounts due from progress payments and performance-based payments, and direct the Contractor, in writing, to withhold five percent from its billings on interim cost vouchers on cost-reimbursement, labor-hour, and time-and-materials contracts until the Contracting Officer has determined that the Contractor has corrected all significant deficiencies as directed by the Contracting Officer’s final determination.  The Contractor shall, within 45 days of receipt of the notice, either correct the deficiencies or submit an acceptable corrective action plan showing milestones and actions to eliminate the deficiencies. </p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  If the Contractor submits an acceptable corrective action plan within 45 days of receipt of a notice of the Contracting Officer’s intent to withhold payments, and the Contracting Officer, in consultation with the auditor or functional specialist, determines that the Contractor is effectively implementing such plan, the Contracting Officer will reduce withholding directly related to the significant deficiencies covered under the corrective action plan, to two percent from progress payments and performance-based payments, and direct the Contractor, in writing, to reduce the percentage withheld on interim cost vouchers to two percent until the Contracting Officer determines the Contractor has corrected all significant deficiencies as directed by the Contracting Officer’s final determination.  However, if at any time, the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor has failed to follow the accepted corrective action plan, the Contracting Officer will increase withholding from progress payments and performance-based payments, and direct the Contractor, in writing, to increase the percentage withheld on interim cost vouchers to the percentage initially withheld, until the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor has corrected all significant deficiencies as directed by the Contracting Officer’s final determination.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(f)  <em class="ph i">Correction of deficiencies</em>.  (1)  The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer, in writing, when the Contractor has corrected the business system’s deficiencies.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  Once the Contractor has notified the Contracting Officer that all deficiencies have been corrected, the Contracting Officer will take one of the following actions: </p>
         <p class="p List3">(i)  If the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor has corrected all significant deficiencies as directed by the Contracting Officer’s final determination, the Contracting Officer will, as appropriate, discontinue the withholding of progress payments and performance-based payments, and direct the Contractor, in writing, to discontinue the payment withholding from billings on interim cost vouchers under this contract associated with the Contracting Officer’s final determination, and authorize the Contractor to bill for any monies previously withheld that are not also being withheld due to other significant deficiencies.  Any payment withholding under this contract due to other significant deficiencies, will remain in effect until the Contracting Officer determines that those significant deficiencies are corrected.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii)  If the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor still has significant deficiencies, the Contracting Officer will continue the withholding of progress payments and performance-based payments, and the Contractor shall continue withholding amounts from its billings on interim cost vouchers in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause, and not bill for any monies previously withheld.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii)  If the Contracting Officer determines, based on the evidence submitted by the Contractor, that there is a reasonable expectation that the corrective actions have been implemented and are expected to correct the significant deficiencies, the Contracting Officer will discontinue withholding payments, and release any payments previously withheld directly related to the significant deficiencies identified in the Contractor notification, and direct the Contractor, in writing, to discontinue the payment withholding from billings on interim cost vouchers associated with the Contracting Officer’s final determination, and authorize the Contractor to bill for any monies previously withheld.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv)  If, within 90 days of receipt of the Contractor notification that the Contractor has corrected the significant deficiencies, the Contracting Officer has not made a determination in accordance with paragraphs (f)(2)(i), (ii ), or (iii) of this clause, the Contracting Officer will reduce withholding directly related to the significant deficiencies identified in the Contractor notification by at least 50 percent of the amount being withheld from progress payments and performance-based payments, and direct the Contractor, in writing, to reduce the payment withholding from billings on interim cost vouchers directly related to the significant deficiencies identified in the Contractor notification by a specified percentage that is at least 50 percent, but not authorize the Contractor to bill for any monies previously withheld until the Contracting Officer makes a determination in accordance with paragraphs (f)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this clause.  </p>
         <p class="p List3">(v)  At any time after the Contracting Officer reduces or discontinues the withholding of progress payments and performance-based payments, or directs the Contractor to reduce or discontinue the payment withholding from billings on interim cost vouchers under this contract, if the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor has failed to correct the significant deficiencies identified in the Contractor's notification, the Contracting Officer will reinstate or increase withholding from progress payments and performance-based payments, and direct the Contractor, in writing, to reinstate or increase the percentage withheld on interim cost vouchers to the percentage initially withheld, until the Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor has corrected all significant deficiencies as directed by the Contracting Officer’s final determination.</p>
