Use a maximum amount or a maximum period for assessing liquidated damages if these limits reflect the maximum probable damage to the Government. Also, the contracting officer may use more than one liquidated damages rate when the contracting officer expects the probable damage to the Government to change over the contract period of performance.</p><p class=" ListL1" id="FAR_11_401__d685e34"> <span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> The contracting officer must take all reasonable steps to mitigate liquidated damages.
