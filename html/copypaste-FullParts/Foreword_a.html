         <p class="p">The FAR is the primary regulation for use by all executive
agencies in their acquisition of supplies and services with appropriated
funds. It became effective on April 1, 1984, and is issued within
applicable laws under the joint authorities of the Administrator
of General Services, the Secretary of Defense, and the Administrator
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, under the
broad policy guidelines of the Administrator, Office of Federal
Procurement Policy, Office of Management and Budget.</p>
         <p class="p">The FAR precludes agency acquisition regulations that unnecessarily
repeat, paraphrase, or otherwise restate the FAR, limits agency
acquisition regulations to those necessary to implement FAR policies
and procedures within an agency, and provides for coordination,
simplicity, and uniformity in the Federal acquisition process. It
also provides for agency and public participation in developing
the FAR and agency acquisition regulation.</p>
         <p class="p">The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) includes all Federal
Acquisition Circulars through 2021-06 effective July 12, 2021. Beginning
in fiscal year 2019, designation of Federal Acquisition Circulars
was changed to reflect the fiscal year in the first four digits
and the sequence of the issued circular in the last two digits.</p>
