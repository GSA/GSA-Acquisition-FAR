         <p class="p">
            <em class="ph i">“</em>Covered system<em class="ph i">”</em> means a national security system, as that term is defined at 44 U.S.C. 3552(b) (see 10 U.S.C. 2339a). It is any information system, including any telecommunications system, used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency, or other organization on behalf of an agency—</p>

         <p class="p List2">(2) Is protected at all times by procedures established for information that have been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order or an Act of Congress to be kept classified in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.</p>
         <p class="p">“Information technology” (see 40 U.S.C 11101(6)) means, in lieu of the definition at <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 2.1</span>, any equipment, or interconnected system(s) or subsystem(s) of equipment, that is used in the automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information by the agency.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) For purposes of this definition, equipment is used by an agency if the equipment is used by the agency directly or is used by a contractor under a contract with the agency that requires—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Its use; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) To a significant extent, its use in the performance of a service or the furnishing of a product.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The term “information technology” includes computers, ancillary equipment (including imaging peripherals, input, output, and storage devices necessary for security and surveillance), peripheral equipment designed to be controlled by the central processing unit of a computer, software, firmware and similar procedures, services (including support services), and related resources.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) The term “information technology” does not include any equipment acquired by a contractor incidental to a contract.</p>
         <p class="p">“Supply chain risk” means the risk that an adversary may sabotage, maliciously introduce unwanted function, or otherwise subvert the design, integrity, manufacturing, production, distribution, installation, operation, or maintenance of a covered system so as to surveil, deny, disrupt, or otherwise degrade the function, use, or operation of such system (see 10 U.S.C. 2339a).</p>

         <p class="p">As used in this subpart—</p>
         <p class="p">“Authorizing official,” as described in DoD Instruction 8510.01, Risk Management Framework (RMF) for DoD Information Technology (IT), means the senior Federal official or executive with the authority to formally assume responsibility for operating an information system at an acceptable level of risk to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.</p>
         <p class="p">“Cloud computing” means a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This includes other commercial terms, such as on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service.  It also includes commercial offerings for software-as-a-service, infrastructure-as-a-service, and platform-as-a-service.</p>
         <p class="p">“Government data” means any information, document, media, or machine readable material regardless of physical form or characteristics, that is created or obtained by the Government in the course of official Government business.</p>
         <p class="p">“Government-related data” means any information, document, media, or machine readable material regardless of physical form or characteristics that is created or obtained by a contractor through the storage, processing, or communication of Government data. This does not include a contractor’s business records (e.g., financial records, legal records, etc.) or data such as operating procedures, software coding, or algorithms that are not uniquely applied to the Government data.</p>
         <p class="p">“Information system” means a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.</p>
         <p class="p">“Media” means physical devices or writing surfaces including, but not limited to, magnetic tapes, optical disks, magnetic disks, large-scale integration memory chips, and printouts onto which information is recorded, stored, or printed within an information system.</p>

         <p class="p">(a) Generally, DoD shall acquire cloud computing services using commercial terms and conditions that are consistent with Federal law, and an agency’s needs, including those requirements specified in this subpart. Some examples of commercial terms and conditions are license agreements, End User License Agreements (EULAs), Terms of Service (TOS), or other similar legal instruments or agreements. Contracting officers shall incorporate any applicable service provider terms and conditions into the contract by attachment or other appropriate mechanism. Contracting officers shall carefully review commercial terms and conditions and consult counsel to ensure these are consistent with Federal law, regulation, and the agency’s needs.</p>
         <p class="p">(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the contracting officer shall only award a contract to acquire cloud computing services from a cloud service provider (e.g., contractor or subcontractor, regardless of tier) that has been granted provisional authorization by Defense Information Systems Agency, at the level appropriate to the requirement, to provide the relevant cloud computing services in accordance with the Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide (SRG) (version in effect at the time the solicitation is issued or as authorized by the contracting officer) found at http://iase.disa.mil/cloud_security/Pages/index.aspx.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) The contracting officer may award a contract to acquire cloud computing services from a cloud service provider that has not been granted provisional authorization when—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The requirement for a provisional authorization is waived by the DoD Chief Information Officer; or</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The cloud computing service requirement is for a private, on-premises version that will be provided from U.S. Government facilities. Under this circumstance, the cloud service provider must obtain a provisional authorization prior to operational use.</p>
         <p class="p">(c) When contracting for cloud computing services, the contracting officer shall ensure the following information is provided by the requiring activity:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Government data and Government-related data descriptions.</p>
         <p class="p">(2) Data ownership, licensing, delivery and disposition instructions specific to the relevant types of Government data and Government-related data (e.g., DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List; work statement task; line item). Disposition instructions shall provide for the transition of data in commercially available, or open and non-proprietary format (and for permanent records, in accordance with disposition guidance issued by National Archives and Record Administration).</p>
         <p class="p">(3) Appropriate requirements to support applicable inspection, audit, investigation, or other similar authorized activities specific to the relevant types of Government data and Government-related data, or specific to the type of cloud computing services being acquired.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Appropriate requirements to support and cooperate with applicable system-wide search and access capabilities for inspections, audits, investigations.</p>
