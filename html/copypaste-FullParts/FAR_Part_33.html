Agency procedures and/or solicitations shall notify potential bidders and offerors whether this independent review is available as an alternative to consideration by the contracting officer of a protest or is available as an appeal of a contracting officer decision on a protest. Agencies shall designate the official(s) who are to conduct this independent review, but the official(s) need not be within the contracting officer’s supervisory chain. When practicable, officials designated to conduct the independent review should not have had previous personal involvement in the procurement. If there is an agency appellate review of the contracting officer’s decision on the protest, it will not extend GAO’s timeliness requirements. Therefore, any subsequent protest to the GAO must be filed within 10 days of knowledge of initial adverse agency action (4 CFR21.2(a)(3)).</p>

(A claim arising under a contract is a claim that can be resolved under a contract clause, other than the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR_Part_52.html#FAR_52_233_1">52.233-1</a>, Disputes, that provides for the relief sought by the claimant; however, relief for such claim can also be sought under the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR_Part_52.html#FAR_52_233_1">52.233-1</a>.
