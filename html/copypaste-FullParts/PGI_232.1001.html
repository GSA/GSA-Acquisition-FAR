         <p class="p List1">(a) <em class="ph i">Contracting officer action</em>. Performance-based payments are not practical for use on all fixed price contracts and require considerable effort between the contractor and Government to identify the appropriate performance-based payment events and establish the proper completion criteria for those events. Additionally, <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 32.1003</span> prohibits contracts from having both progress payments and performance-based payment financing on a contract at the same time. Additional information and instruction on performance-based payments are provided in the DoD Performance-based Payments Guide on the DPAP website in the Cost, Pricing &amp; Finance section under the Performance Based Payments â€“ Guide Book &amp; Analysis Tool tab: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/cpic/cp/Performance_based_payments.html</p>
