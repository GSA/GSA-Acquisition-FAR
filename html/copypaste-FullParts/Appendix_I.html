         <span class="ph autonumber">I-100</span>Purpose.</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p List1">(a) This Appendix I to 48 CFR Chapter 2 implements the Pilot Mentor-Protege Program (hereafter referred to as the “Program”) established under section 831 of Public Law 101-510, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (10 U.S.C. 2302 note), as amended through November 25, 2015. The purpose of the Program is to provide incentives to major DoD contractors to furnish eligible small business concerns with assistance designed to—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Enhance the capabilities of eligible small business concerns to perform as subcontractors and suppliers under DoD contracts and other contracts and subcontracts; and</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Increase the participation of such business concerns as subcontractors and suppliers under DoD contracts, other Federal Government contracts, and commercial contracts.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Under the Program, eligible companies approved as mentor firms will enter into mentor-protege agreements with eligible protege firms to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of the protege firms to perform as subcontractors and suppliers. DoD may provide the mentor firm with either cost reimbursement or credit against applicable subcontracting goals established under contracts with DoD or other Federal agencies.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) DoD will measure the overall success of the Program by the extent to which the Program results in—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) An increase in the dollar value of contract and subcontract awards to protege firms (under DoD contracts, contracts awarded by other Federal agencies, and commercial contracts) from the date of their entry into the Program until 2 years after the conclusion of the agreement;</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) An increase in the number and dollar value of subcontracts awarded to a protege firm (or former protege firm) by its mentor firm (or former mentor firm); and</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) An increase in the employment level of protege firms from the date of entry into the Program until 2 years after the completion of the agreement.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) This policy sets forth the procedures for participation in the Program applicable to companies that are interested in receiving—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Reimbursement through a separate contract line item in a DoD contract or a separate contract with DoD; or</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Credit toward applicable subcontracting goals for costs incurred under the Program.</p>

         <p class="p List1">(a) Prospective mentors and their proteges may choose to execute letters of intent prior to negotiation of mentor-protege agreements.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) The agreements should be structured after completion of a preliminary assessment of the developmental needs of the protege firm and mutual agreement regarding the developmental assistance to be provided to address those needs and enhance the protege’s ability to perform successfully under contracts or subcontracts.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) A mentor firm may not require a protege firm to enter into a mentor-protege agreement as a condition for award of a contract by the mentor firm, including a subcontract under a DoD contract awarded to the mentor firm.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d) The mentor-protege agreement may provide for the mentor firm to furnish any or all of the following types of developmental assistance:</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Assistance by mentor firm personnel in—</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) General business management, including organizational management, financial management, and personnel management, marketing, and overall business planning;</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Engineering and technical matters such as production inventory control and quality assurance; and</p>

         <p class="p List2">(2) Award of subcontracts to the protege firm under DoD contracts or other contracts on a noncompetitive basis.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Payment of progress payments for the performance of subcontracts by a protege firm in amounts as provided for in the subcontract; but in no event may any such progress payment exceed 100 percent of the costs incurred by the protege firm for the performance of the subcontract. Provision of progress payments by a mentor firm to a protege firm at a rate other than the customary rate for the firm must be implemented in accordance with <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 32.504</span>(c).</p>
         <p class="p List2">(4) Advance payments under such subcontracts. The mentor firm must administer advance payments in accordance with <span class="ph FARxref">FAR Subpart 32.4</span>.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(5) Loans.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) Assistance that the mentor firm obtains for the protege firm from one or more of the following:</p>
         <p class="p List1">(i) Small Business Development Centers established pursuant to section 21 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 648).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Entities providing procurement technical assistance pursuant to 10 U.S.C. Chapter 142 (Procurement Technical Assistance Centers).</p>

         <p class="p List1">(e) Pursuant to <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 31.109</span>, approved mentor firms seeking either reimbursement or credit are strongly encouraged to enter into an advance agreement with the contracting officer responsible for determining final indirect cost rates under <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 42.705</span>. The purpose of the advance agreement is to establish the accounting treatment of the costs of the developmental assistance pursuant to the mentor-protege agreement prior to the incurring of any costs by the mentor firm. An advance agreement is an attempt by both the Government and the mentor firm to avoid possible subsequent dispute based on questions related to reasonableness, allocability, or allowability of the costs of developmental assistance under the Program. Absent an advance agreement, mentor firms are advised to establish the accounting treatment of such costs and to address the need for any changes to their cost accounting practices that may result from the implementation of a mentor-protege agreement, prior to incurring any costs, and irrespective of whether costs will be reimbursed or credited.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) Developmental assistance provided under an approved mentor-protege agreement is distinct from, and must not duplicate, any effort that is the normal and expected product of the award and administration of the mentor firm's subcontracts. Costs associated with the latter must be accumulated and charged in accordance with the contractor's approved accounting practices; they are not considered developmental assistance costs eligible for either credit or reimbursement under the Program.</p>
