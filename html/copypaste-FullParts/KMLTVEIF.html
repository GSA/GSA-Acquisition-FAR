Guide Supplement, refers to the definition of “major acquisition”
as a capital project that requires special management attention

development, operating, or maintenance costs; (3) high risk; (4)
high return; or (5) significant role in the administration of an
agency’s programs, finances, property, or other resources.</p>

below)). EVMS requirements shall be included in commercial and non-commercial

developmental or modernization work, as defined by OMB’s definition

The performance schedule also must identify the program’s critical path. The performance schedule is to be constructed using a software tool compatible with standard scheduling software.
