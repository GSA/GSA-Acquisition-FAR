Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, including withholding or
offsetting payments and interest on the debt (see FAR clause 52.232-17,
Interest). If the Contractor fails to submit the required sales
reports, falsifies them, or fails to timely pay the CAF, these reasons
constitute sufficient cause for the Government to terminate the
contract for cause.</p>

						            &nbsp;The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by determining the lowest base period price. When option year pricing is based on a formula (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>,changes in the Producer Price Index or other common standard), option year pricing is automatically considered when evaluating the base year price, as any change in price will be uniformly related to changes in market conditions. All options are therefore considered to be evaluated. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>

will not be considered as meeting the criteria for award established
by the Government. In this connection, a discount will be considered
uneconomical if the annualized rate of return for earning the discount
is lower than the “value of funds” rate established by the Department
of the Treasury and published quarterly in the Federal Register.
The “value of funds” rate applied will be the rate in effect on
the date specified for the receipt of offers.</p>

                   &nbsp;Offerors
are requested to insert, in the spaces provided below or by attachment
hereto, a separate charge for “Delivery Within Consignee's Premises”
applicable to each shipping container to be shipped. (Articles which
are comparable in size and weight, and for which the same charge
is applicable, should be grouped under an appropriate item description.)
These additional charges will be accepted as part of the award,
if considered reasonable, and shall be included in the Contractor's published
catalog and/or price list.</p>

                   Ordering
activities are not obligated to issue orders on the basis of “Delivery
Within Consignee's Premises,” and Contractors may refuse delivery
on that basis provided such refusal is communicated in writing to
the ordering activity issuing such orders within 5 days of the receipt
of such order by the Contractor and provided further, that delivery
is made in accordance with the other delivery requirements of the
contract. Failure of the Contractor to submit this notification
within the time specified shall constitute acceptance to furnish
“Delivery Within Consignee's Premises” at the additional charge awarded.
When an ordering activity issues an order on the basis of “Delivery
Within Consignee's Premises” at the accepted additional charge awarded
and the Contractor accepts such orders on that basis, the Contractor
will be obligated to provide delivery “F.o.b. Destination, Within
Consignee's Premises” in accordance with FAR 52.247-35, which is
then incorporated by reference, with the exception that an additional
charge as provided herein is allowed for such services. Unless otherwise stipulated
by the Offeror, the additional charges awarded hereunder may be
applied to any delivery within the 48 contiguous States and the
District of Columbia.</p>

background.</em> The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA)
of 1994 requires the Government to evolve its acquisition process
from one driven by paper to an expedited process based on electronic
commerce/electronic data interchange (EC/EDI). EC/EDI encompasses
more than merely automating manual processes and eliminating paper
transactions. EC/EDI improves business processes (e.g. procurement,
finance, logistics) into a fully electronic environment and fundamentally
changes the way organizations operate.</p>

Security Presidential Directive 12 (HSPD-12), “Policy for a Common

the requirement for a mandatory Government-wide standard for secure and
reliable forms of identification issued by the Federal Government
to its employees and Contractor employees assigned to Government
contracts in order to enhance security, increase Government efficiency,
reduce identity fraud, and protect personal privacy. Further, the
Directive requires the Department of Commerce to promulgate a Federal
standard for secure and reliable forms of identification within
six months of the date of the Directive. As a result, the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released Federal Information
Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-2: Personal Identity Verification
of Federal Employees and Contractors August 2013. FIPS 201-2 requires
that the digital certificates incorporated into the Personal Identity
Verification (PIV) identity credentials comply with the X.509 Certificate
Policy for the U.S. Federal PKI Common Policy Framework. In addition,
FIPS 201-2 requires that Federal identity badges referred to as
PIV credentials, issued to Federal employees and Contractors comply
with the Standard and associated NIST Special Publications 800-73,
800-76, 800-78, and 800-79.</p>

the patent indemnity clause, and the portion of the Commercial Item
Contract Terms and Conditions that specifies “Compliance with laws
unique to Government contracts” (which applies only to contracts
with entities of the Executive branch of the U.S. Government). The
parties to this new contract which incorporates the terms and conditions
of the Schedule contract are the individual ordering activity and
the Contractor. The U.S. Government shall not be liable for the
performance or nonperformance of the new contract. Disputes which
cannot be resolved by the parties to the new contract may be litigated in
any State or Federal court with jurisdiction over the parties, applying
Federal procurement law, including statutes, regulations and case
law, and, if pertinent, the Uniform Commercial Code. To the extent
authorized by law, parties to this new contract are encouraged to
resolve disputes through Alternative Dispute Resolution. Likewise,
a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA), although not a contract, is
an agreement that may be entered into by the Contractor with such an
entity and the Federal Government is not a party.</p>

                         The inspection system maintained
by the Contractor under the Inspection of Supplies—Fixed Price clause
(FAR 52.246-2) of this contract shall be maintained throughout the
contract period. Unless otherwise authorized in writing by the Contracting
Officer, the Contractor shall comply with all requirements of editions
in effect on the date of the solicitation of either Federal Standard
368 or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
Standard 9001:2000 (Quality Management Systems—Requirements). A
documented description of the inspection system shall be made available
to the Government before contract award. At the sole discretion
of the Contracting Officer, he/she may authorize in writing exceptions
to the quality assurance standards identified above. The Contractor
shall immediately notify the Administrative Contracting Officer
(ACO) of any changes made in the inspection system during the contract
period. As used herein, the term “inspection system” means the Contractor’s
own facility or any other facility acceptable to the Government
that will be used to perform inspections or tests of materials and
components before incorporation into end articles and for inspection
of such end articles before shipment. When the manufacturing plant
is located outside of the United States, the Contractor shall arrange
delivery of the items from a plant or warehouse located in the United
States (including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) equipped
to perform all inspections and tests required by the contract or
specifications to evidence conformance therewith, or shall arrange
with a testing laboratory or other facility in the United States,
acceptable to the Government, to perform the required inspections
and tests.</p>

testing were performed. These records shall be available for (i) 3
years after final payment; or (ii) 4 years from the end of the Contractor’s
fiscal year in which the record was created, whichever period expires
first.</p>

notifies the Contractor of its intent to inspect supplies before
shipment, the Contractor shall notify or arrange for subcontractors

a printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression (exclusive of
a postage meter machine impression) that is readily identifiable

to evaluate proposals and award a lease after conducting discussions
with offerors whose proposals have been determined to be within
the competitive range. If the Contracting Officer determines that
the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive
range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be
conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals
in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit
an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.

best terms from a price and technical standpoint.</p>

that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially
unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing
exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price
of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or
understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis
techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer
determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to
the Government.</p>
