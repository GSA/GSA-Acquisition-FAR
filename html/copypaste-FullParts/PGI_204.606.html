         <p class="p">Do not enter a generic DUNS number used for reporting
to the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) (see FAR Subpart <span class="ph FARxref">4.6</span>), nor a generic
CAGE code that corresponds to a generic DUNS number, on any contractual
document. These generic codes shall only be used for reporting to
FPDS. Using the generic codes on actual contract actions masks the
true identity of the vendor and immediately makes any accurate electronic
processing of invoices, receiving reports, and payments impossible;
and can, in fact, result in misdirected payments. As a reminder
FAR Subpart <span class="ph FARxref">4.18</span> requires
each contractor be identified by its actual CAGE code on contract
actions; there is no exemption to the requirement for an actual
CAGE code.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) <em class="ph i">Methods of reporting to FPDS</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) <em class="ph i">Individual contract action report
(CAR) (one CAR per contract action)</em>. The normal method of reporting
to FPDS is through the use of individual CARs.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) An individual CAR is required to be
reported for each of the following types of awards regardless of
the estimated value of the award:</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) Indefinite-delivery contract.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) Blanket purchase agreement (prescribed
by FAR parts 8 or 13).</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">3</em>) Basic ordering agreement.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">4</em>) Basic agreement (only if the
agreement has a value and potential obligations greater than $0).</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">5</em>) Task and delivery orders and
calls issued under any agreement or indefinite-delivery contract
(including Federal Supply Schedules, Governmentwide acquisition
contracts, or multi-agency contracts).</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">6</em>) Modification to any contract,
agreement, order, or call where a CAR is required for the base award
regardless of the amount being obligated or deobligated on the modification.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B)(<em class="ph i">1</em>) An individual CAR is required
to be reported for each of the following types of awards when the
award process was conducted using other than micro-purchase procedures
and the value is greater than the micro-purchase threshold (MPT):</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">i</em>) Purchase order.</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">ii</em>) Definitive contract.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) Although a contract action report
is not required for these awards when micro-purchase procedures
were followed and the value is less than the MPT, it is encouraged
as a best practice if the award was not accomplished using the Governmentwide
commercial purchase card (GPC) or a Standard Form 44. Additionally, when
the purchase order or definitive contract being awarded is in response
to a contingency, an individual report is required when the value
of the award is greater than $25,000, not the MPT of $30,000 referenced in
FAR part 2.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) See paragraphs (1)(ii) and (iii) of
this section for exceptions to individual reporting.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) <em class="ph i">Multiple CARs (more than one CAR
per contract action)</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Prepare multiple CARs if the contract
or order award is anticipated to include both foreign funding and
U.S. funding.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) The determination of whether multiple
CARs are needed for the situations described in paragraph (1)(ii)(A)
of this section is made when the contract or order is awarded. Contracting
officers are not required to delete and re-enter CARs in FPDS as
multiple CARs if, during the life of the contract or order, subsequent
unanticipated modifications make the award eligible for multiple
CARs.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) The following multiple CAR transaction
identification numbers have been established for reporting multiple CARs
and shall be used by all DoD contracting offices. Do not use transaction
numbers other than “0” if the requirements for multiple CARs in
paragraphs (1)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section do not apply at the
time of contract or order award. When reporting modifications, include
the transaction number that was reported on the initial base award
in order to properly identify the referenced contract action report.
If the situation described in paragraph (1)(ii)(A) of this section
exists, transaction numbers should be assigned based on foreign
military sales (FMS) and non-FMS rather than by type of contract
pricing arrangement. Do not use multiple CARs with transaction numbers
other than “0” if the entire award is expected to be funded by foreign
funding.</p>
         <p class="p">Transaction Type Transaction Number</p>
         <p class="p">No multiple CARs 0</p>

reporting of multiple contract actions, to be submitted at least
monthly).</em>
         </p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Express reporting may be used for—</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) Multiple contract actions against
a single contract or agreement, when monthly volume of actions is
such that individual contract action reporting is overly burdensome
(e.g., orders placed by the Defense Commissary Agency; installation
housing maintenance; and recurring blanket purchase agreement actions);</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) Multiple contract actions accomplished
away from the contracting office, such as ships away from home port;
contingency, humanitarian, or peacekeeping operations; or other
remote deployments;</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">3</em>) Multiple delivery orders that
use the GPC as both the method of purchase and payment under Federal
Supply Schedules, Governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWACs),
blanket purchase agreements (BPAs), basic ordering agreements (BOAs),
and other indefinite-delivery type contracts;</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">4</em>) Multiple contract actions for
energy-related supplies and associated services accomplished by
Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Energy; and</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">5</em>) Orders under communications
service agreements for local dial tone services, in accordance with
agency procedures.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) When express reports reflect more than
one contractor for overseas actions or consolidated delivery orders
made using the GPC where identification of the contract or agreement
is not possible, use the appropriate generic DUNS number.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) When express reports are used, sum
all of the actions and enter in the “Number of Actions” data field.
Also sum all of the obligations and enter in the “Action Obligation,”
“Base and Exercised Options Value,” and “Base and All Options Value”
data fields. Express reports shall be submitted no less frequently
than monthly.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) When express reports are used, the
contracting officer must maintain a log of individual actions being
summarized on the express reports and ensure it is available for
audit purposes. Logs must include the following, at a minimum, for
each action: procurement instrument identifier (PIID) used for the
express report under which action is summarized, referenced Indefinite-Delivery
Vehicles (IDV) PIID (if the express report is summarizing task/delivery/call
orders), date of award, obligation amount, vendor name, and DUNS
number (if known).</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) <em class="ph i">Actions not reported</em>. In addition,
to the types of actions listed in <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 4.606</span>(c), do not report the
following types of actions to FPDS:</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Orders placed by ordering officers
against IDVs awarded by—</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) The United States Transportation Command
(USTRANSCOM) or its components for decentralized transportation-related
services. USTRANSCOM will report these orders. Contracting officers
shall submit consolidated reports of orders (bookings/bills of lading)
at least annually to USTRANSCOM; or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) DLA Energy for energy-related supplies
and associated services using defensewide working capital funds.
DLA Energy will report these orders. It is the responsibility of
the contracting office to ensure that orders placed against these
vehicles using other than defensewide working capital funds are
reported to FPDS.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Contracts, agreements, or orders that
are themselves classified.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) <em class="ph i">Specific instructions for entering
data in FPDS</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Contracting officers shall choose the
correct FPDS format (e.g., purchase order, basic ordering agreement
(BOA), blanket purchase agreement (BPA)) to report the award of
a new contract, agreement, or order. Note that prior to fiscal year
(FY)10, DoD offices reported BOAs and BPAs as IDCs in FPDS; BPA
calls issued under those pre-FY10 reported BPAs are reported using
the task/delivery order format in FPDS. BPA calls issued under DoD
issued BPAs reported FY10 or later or any civilian agency issued
BPA should be reported using the BPA call format.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The remaining instructions in this
section cover the different sections of an FPDS contract action
report, as presented to the user in the system. Not every data element
is addressed here, as many are self-explanatory. Users should also consult
the FPDS User Manual referenced in PGI <span class="ph PGIxref">

         <p class="p List3">(iii) <em class="ph i">FPDS Entry – Document Information
Section</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Enter the new contract, agreement,
or order number in the “Procurement Instrument Identifier” data
field. Note that new awards will be reflected as Modification 0
in FPDS.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) If the action is a BPA awarded against
a Federal Supply Schedule, enter the Federal Supply Schedule contract number
in the “Referenced IDV ID” data field.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) If the action is a delivery order awarded
against a Federal Supply Schedule, Governmentwide acquisition contract
(GWAC), BOA, or other IDC; enter that contract or BOA number in
the “Referenced IDV ID” data field.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) If the action is a BPA call awarded
against a BPA, enter the BPA number in the “Referenced IDV ID” data
field.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) If the action is a modification, enter
the contract, agreement, or order number in the “Procurement Instrument Identifier”
data field and the modification number in the “Modification Number”
data field.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(F) If multiple reports are required by
paragraph (1)(ii) of this section, then enter the appropriate transaction
number in the “Transaction Number” data field.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(G) If the award is associated with a solicitation,
enter the solicitation number in the “Solicitation ID” data field.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(H) If the award is associated with an
initiative identified in FPDS (e.g., American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act), choose the appropriate value in the “Treasury Account Symbol
Initiative” data field.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) <em class="ph i">FPDS Entry –Treasury Account Symbol
(TAS) data fields</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) TAS data fields are no longer required
to be entered in FPDS (as of July 2016) and should be left blank;
however, if correcting TAS data fields on a previously reported
contract action report follow the instructions in this section.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) The TAS should be provided by the requiring
organization with the purchase request, and is often part of the line
of accounting. The list of valid TAS is maintained by the Department
of Treasury in the FASTBook; an on-line version of the FASTBook
is available at http://www.fms.treas.gov/fastbook/index.html. Each
TAS reported to FPDS includes a character agency identifier and
a four character main account code (example: 97 0100). Some TAS
also require a three character subaccount code. Note that the Department
of Treasury FASTBook indicates a transition from a two character
agency identifier to a three character agency identifier. However
at this time, DoD contracting officers are advised to drop the leading
zero (0) from a three character agency identifier, and enter the
next two characters in FPDS (e.g., 097 becomes 97).</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Report the TAS on CARs for each contract
action with an obligation amount other than $0. The TAS that is reported
on a CAR should represent the predominant type of funding in terms
of absolute dollars obligated and deobligated on the specific contract
action being reported.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) For contract actions awarded by working
capital funds offices, and the original type of funds received from
the customer are not tied to specific procurements or otherwise
identifiable, use the TAS that represents the working capital funds
provided.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) For contract actions funded by foreign
governments, and those funds are not considered under the Foreign
Military Financing Program identified by the Department of Treasury
in its FASTBook, in order to report the action to FPDS using the
code that most closely approximates the use of the funds, then enter—</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) 97 0100 (Operation and Maintenance,
Defense-Wide, Defense) as the TAS for requirements that can be categorized
as operations and maintenance in nature;</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) 97 0300 (Procurement, Defense-Wide)
as the TAS for requirements that can be categorized as procurement in
nature; or</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">3</em>) 97 0400 (Research, Development,
Test, and Evaluation, Defense-Wide) as the TAS for requirements
that can be categorized as research and development in nature.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(F) USTRANSCOM should use 97 0100 (Operation
and Maintenance, Defense-Wide, Defense) as the TAS when reporting
the consolidated orders of from their decentralized transportation-related
services contracts.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) <em class="ph i">FPDS Entry – Dates Section</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) The “Date Signed” data field represents
the date the contracting officer signed or otherwise awarded the
contract action.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) The “Effective Date” data field represents
the date the period of performance begins. For actions where an
authorization to proceed was given prior to the signed contract
action, use the date of the authorization in this data element.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) The date entered in the “Completion
Date” data field shall be the latest period of performance / delivery
date of all of the exercised line items on the contract or order.
This data field shall be updated on the contract action report used
to report the modification whenever line items are added or exercised
by modification that extend the period of performance / delivery
date beyond what was previously entered, including the exercise
of any option years.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) The date entered in the “Estimated
Ultimate Completion Date” data field shall be the latest period
of performance / delivery date of all line items on the contract
or order, including unexercised line items and option years. This data
field shall be updated on the contract action report used to report
the modification whenever line items are added or changed by modification
that extend the period of performance/delivery date beyond what
was previously entered.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) The date entered in the “Last Date
to Order” data field on IDCs, BOAs, and BPAs shall be the last date
allowed by the contract for the contractor to accept orders. This
data field shall be updated whenever this date is changed by modification
from what was previously entered.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(F) The “Solicitation Date” data field
generally represents the date an Invitation for Bids, Request for
Quotation, or Request for Proposal was issued to potential bidders
or offerors. However, follow the instructions below for other situations
where an IFB, RFQ, or RFP is not issued:</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) When the action is the award
of an order using existing pre-priced line items under an ordering
instrument where no proposal is required (i.e., there are no elements
of the delivery or performance to negotiate)—</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">i</em>) <em class="ph i">Orders under single-award
indefinite delivery vehicles, BPA calls under single-award BPAs
issued under FAR part 8, and BPA calls under BPAs issued under FAR
part 13</em>. Use the date the procurement-ready requirements package
(including funded purchase request or MIPR) was provided to the
contracting office as the “Solicitation Date”. If unknown, use the
date of the award of the order as the “Solicitation Date”.</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">ii</em>) <em class="ph i">Orders under multiple-award
indefinite delivery contracts and BPA calls issued under multiple-award BPAs
issued under FAR part 8</em>. Use the date of the survey of the multiple-award
contracts or BPAs prices in accordance with FAR part 8 or 16 procedures.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) When the action is the award
of a contract under a broad agency announcement (BAA), use the date
when a final (not draft) combined synopsis/solicitation is issued
as the “Solicitation Date” except—</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">i</em>) For two-step BAAs, including
white paper submissions for review, selection, and subsequent request for
full proposals, the “Solicitation Date” is the date when the contracting
officer signs the proposal request;</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">ii</em>) Under BAAs with calls, the
“Solicitation Date” is the date when the individual call is issued;
or</p>
         <p class="p List7">(<em class="ph i">iii</em>) For open BAAs, when white
papers and/or proposals are accepted for review over an extended
period (typically open for a year or longer), the “Solicitation
Date” is either the date when the contracting officer signs a proposal
request (white papers) or the date on which the proposal is submitted,
whichever is earlier.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">3</em>) For awards made in response
to unsolicited proposals, the “Solicitation Date” is the date when
the offeror is notified of proposal acceptance for negotiations
and/or award.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vi) <em class="ph i">FPDS Entry – Amounts Section</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) When entering a net deobligation on
a contract action, include the minus (-) sign.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) The amount entered in the “Base and
Exercised Options Value” for new awards shall be the total value
(represented in U.S. dollars and cents) of all the exercised line
items on the contract or order regardless of whether they are partially
or fully funded. This data field shall be updated on the contract
action report used to report the modification whenever the current
value of the contract or order is changed by modification, including
when options are exercised. When reporting such a modification,
report the net value of the change itself in “Current” field; FPDS
will calculate the new total Base and Exercised Options Value. When
an Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) executes a modification
and the previous value reported in FPDS is incorrect, the ACO shall
notify the procuring contract office of the discrepancy and enter
the appropriate value in the “Current” field of the “Base and Exercised
Options Value” to ensure a correct total is represented. The ACO
shall document the correction of the discrepancy in the contract
file.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) The amount entered in the “Base and
All Options Value” for new awards shall be the total potential value
of the award (represented in U.S. dollars and cents) (e.g., total
price, total not-to-exceed amount, maximum award amount, etc.),
including the value of all unexercised line items and options. For
blanket purchase agreements and basic ordering agreements, enter
the total expected amount for orders that will be issued. Note:
on IDV formats in FPDS, this data element is named “Base and All
Options Value (Total Contract Value).”</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) For each IDC resulting from
a solicitation where multiple awards were contemplated, this is
the maximum for that resulting specific contract. Note: this amount
is not always the same as the ceiling for the program under which
multiple contracts were awarded. Each contract shall have a specific
ceiling identified for that specific period (see <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 16.504</span>(a)(4)(ii)).</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) This data field shall be updated
on the contract action report used to report the modification whenever
the total potential value is changed by modification, including
changes made as a result of overruns or claims. When reporting such
a modification, report the net value of the change itself in “Current”
field; FPDS will calculate the new total Base and All Options Value.
When an ACO executes a modification and the previous value reported
in FPDS is incorrect, the ACO shall notify the procuring contract
office of the discrepancy and enter the appropriate value in the
“Current” field of the “Base and All Options Value” to ensure a
correct total is represented. The ACO shall document the discrepancy
correction in the contract file.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) The amount entered in the “Action Obligation”
for new awards shall be the total value of all the obligated funds on
the contract or order, represented in U.S. dollars and cents. When
reporting a modification, report the net value of the change in
funding accomplished by the modification in the “Current” field;
FPDS will calculate the new total action obligation value. When
an ACO executes a modification and the previous value reported in
FPDS is incorrect, the ACO shall notify the procuring contract office
of the discrepancy and enter the appropriate value in the “Current”
field of the “Action Obligation Value” field to ensure a correct
total is represented. The ACO shall document the discrepancy correction
in the contract file.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(E) The amount entered in the “Total Estimated
Order Value” for new IDC awards shall be the total estimated value of
all anticipated orders to be placed under the contract. For DoD,
this value should match the “Base and All Options” value, as DoD
does not obligate funds on indefinite-delivery contracts themselves.</p>

         <p class="p List4">(B) If the procurement is for services,
enter the appropriate Inherently Governmental Functions indicator:</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) “Closely Associated” means functions
that are closely associated with inherently governmental functions; those
contractor duties that could expand to become inherently governmental
functions without sufficient management controls or oversight on

Report this code for competitive and noncompetitive contract actions
that used simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR

Program. However, if the action is noncompetitive and the reason
for other than full and open competition is other than “Authorized
by Statute,” “Authorized Resale,” or “SAP Noncompetition,” then
enter “Only One Source Solicited” as the solicitation procedure.
(Note that most times when in conflict, the reason for other than
full and open competition takes precedence over the type of solicitation
procedure used.)</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) <em class="ph i">Only One Source Solicited</em>.

(Note: This terminology is broader than FAR Subpart <span class="ph FARxref">6.2</span>, which includes set-aside actions
and actions to establish or maintain alternate sources, in that
it also includes actions justified by a justification and approval
that provided for competition).</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">4</em>) <em class="ph i">Not Available for Competition</em>.
Report this if the contract action is not available for competition
(i.e., contract actions where the solicitation procedure was “Only
One Source” and the reason not competed is “Authorized by Statute,”
“International Agreement,” “Utilities,” or “Authorized Resale.”)
Note that sole source awards for 8a firms, HUBZone firms, and service-related
disabled veteran-owned concerns should always be identified as “Authorized
by Statute” as the reason for other than full and open competition.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">5</em>) <em class="ph i">Not Competed under SAP</em>.
Report this for non-competitive contract actions that were awarded

         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) If the contract action is a
result of a set-aside or sole source authorized under part 19 of
the FAR, choose the applicable value. In order to indicate a FAR
part 19 set-aside or sole source on an order under a multiple-award
contract, see paragraph (F) of this section.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) Note that the type of set-aside
is collected on the original award. In the case of a task or delivery
order being reported, the user will see the type of set-aside from
the original contract in the “Type Set Aside” data element. The
“Type of Set-Aside Source” data element is system generated to indicate
whether the data in the “Type Set Aside” data element was entered
on the specific CAR being viewed or if it was pre-populated from
the original contract award.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) <em class="ph i">SBIR/STTR</em>. Ensure the “SBIR/STTR”
data field is completed if the contract action is a result of a
Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) or Small Technology Transfer
Research (STTR) Program. SBIR and STTR Phase III awards require
that a previous SBIR or STTR award exists.</p>

If a Federal Supply Schedule contract or a Governmentwide multiple-award
contract is not coded as a multiple-award vehicle, thereby preventing
completion of this field, the FPDS user should advise the agency
FPDS so that the contracting office for the multiple-award contract
can be notified and pursue correction.</p>

Report this if the order was set aside pursuant to <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 19.502-4</span>(c) and a sub-set of multiple-award
contract holders meeting the set-aside criteria were provided fair
opportunity to submit an offer. If this value is selected, also
choose the appropriate set-aside in the “Type of Set-Aside” field.
Do not select this value if the original multiple award contract
itself was set-aside or partially set-aside.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">8</em>) <em class="ph i">Sole Source.</em> Report this

If this value is selected, also choose the appropriate value in
the “Type of Set-Aside” field.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(G) If an award did not provide for full
and open competition; or in the case of simplified acquisition,
did not provide the maximum extent of competition practicable; select
the value in the “Other Than Full and Open Competition” field that
represents the justification used.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(H) In the “Commercial Item Acquisition

Selection</em>—</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) When entering a new contract,
purchase order, or agreement award in FPDS, contracting officers
shall ensure they appropriately choose “Small Business” or “Other
than Small Business” in the “Contracting Officer’s Determination
of Business Size” data field according to the NAICS code applied
to the award, its associated size standard, and the contractor’s
response to provision 52.212-3 or 52.219-1. The contracting officer
shall enter “Other than Small Business” for awards where the contractor
has not certified to its status in one of these provisions.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">2</em>) If the “Contracting Officer’s
Determination of Business Size” data field is completed with “Small
Business”, the contractor’s other socio-economic information that
it has entered or the Small Business Administration (SBA) has provided
to the System for Award Management (SAM) database will be included
in the contract action report. This includes designations such as
SBA-Certified 8(a), Women-owned Small Business, Service Disabled
Veteran Owned.</p>
         <p class="p List6">(<em class="ph i">3</em>) Contracting officers will not
be allowed to identify types of set-asides in FPDS unless the “Contracting Officer’s
Determination of Business Size” field is completed with “Small Business,”
and other required socio-economic designations are present in the
Contractor’s SAM record (e.g., contractor shall have the SBA-Certified

         <p class="p List2">(4) <em class="ph i">Reporting modifications to FPDS</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Modifications against previously reported
contracts, agreements, and orders are required to be reported to
FPDS if they include any obligation or deobligation amount. They
are also required to be reported to FPDS if there is no obligation
or deobligation amount and involve a change to the data reported
in any data field in the contract action report (e.g., vendor name,
completion date, place of performance).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) Contracting officers should choose
the “Reason for Modification” value that best represents the purpose
of the modification action. If more than one reason for modification
applies, choose the more specific value. When a name, address, DUNS
number, or CAGE code change occurs as the result of the modification,
choose “Novation,” “Vendor DUNS Change,” or “Vendor Address Change,”
per the instructions at paragraphs (4)(v), (vi) and (vii), rather
than other values that may also apply to the action (e.g., Exercise
Option).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Do not use “Close Out” as the reason
for modification in FPDS unless the modification being reported
actually accomplishes the close out of the award.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) DoD offices shall not use the “Transfer
Action” value in the “Reason for Modification” field unless transferring the
contract to a non-DoD contracting office (e.g., Department of Interior).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(v) Modifications for novations (see FAR
Subpart <span class="ph FARxref">42.12</span> and
DFARS subpart <span class="ph DFARxref">242.12</span>)
shall use “Novation Agreement” in the “Reason for Modification”
field.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) When this value is used, the contracting
officer shall enter the appropriate DUNS number for the contractor
in the modification contract action report. FPDS will then bring
over the current vendor name and address from the contractor’s SAM
record for that DUNS number into the modification contract action
report. Subsequent contract action reports will show the updated
DUNS number and vendor name.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) When this value is used, FPDS also
allows the contracting officer to update the “Contracting Officer’s
Determination of Business Size” data field. The contracting officer
shall ensure that the contractor’s current size status is appropriately
recorded on the modification contract action report. Subsequent
contract action reports will reflect the size entered on this modification
contract action report (see FAR subparts <span class="ph FARxref">19.301-2</span> and <span class="ph FARxref">19.301-3</span>).</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vi) Modifications for contractor name
changes that do not require a novation (see FAR Subpart <span class="ph FARxref">42.12</span> and DFARS
Subpart <span class="ph DFARxref">242.12</span>)
shall use “Vendor DUNS Change” in the “Reason for Modification”
field. When this value is used, the contracting officer shall enter
the appropriate DUNS number for the contractor in the modification
contract action report. FPDS will then bring over the current vendor
name and address from the contractor’s SAM record for that DUNS
number into the modification contract action report. Subsequent
contract action reports will show the updated DUNS number and vendor
name.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(vii) Modifications for contractor address
changes that do not require a novation shall use “Vendor Address
Change” in the “Reason for Modification” field. When this value
is used, FPDS will bring over the current address from the contractor’s
SAM record into the modification contract action report. Subsequent
contract action reports will show the updated address.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(viii) Modifications for re-representation
actions (see <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 19.301-2</span> and
19.301-3) shall use either “Re-representation” or “Re-representation
of Non-Novated Merger/Acquisition”, as appropriate, in the “Reason
for Modification” field. When this value is used, FPDS allows the
contracting officer to update the “Contracting Officer’s Determination of
Business Size” data field. The contracting officer shall ensure
that the contractor’s current size status is appropriately recorded
on the modification contract action report. Subsequent contract
action reports will reflect the size entered on this modification
contract action report.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ix) When a modification is reported with
“Termination for Default” or “Termination for Cause” in the “Reason
for Modification” data field, the user must also report the termination
to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System
(FAPIIS) in accordance with <span class="ph FARxref">FAR

Contracting offices shall ensure all such purchases made by their
authorized cardholders are reported to FPDS no less frequently than
monthly. Any individual purchase valued greater than $25,000 shall
be reported individually to FPDS. For individual purchases valued
less than $25,000, there are three acceptable methods for reporting

to FPDS using the delivery order or BPA call format that references
the individual contract or BPA, respectively; or</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) Report a consolidated express report
to FPDS using the purchase order format that uses the generic DUNS 136721250
for “GPC Consolidated Reporting” or 136721292 for “GPC Foreign Contractor
Consolidated Reporting”, as appropriate, as the identifier. Note
that when a generic DUNS number is used to report these actions,
only “Other than Small Business” is allowed as the “Contracting
Officer’s Determination of Business Size” selection.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) For orders placed on FedMall, contracting
officers are not required to separately report such awards to FPDS.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(6) <em class="ph i">Using generic DUNS numbers</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) Generic DUNS numbers may only be used
for reporting to FPDS in accordance with <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 4.605</span>(c) or paragraph <span class="ph PGIxref">
               <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#DFARS-PGI_PGI_204.606">204.606</a>
            </span>(5)(ii)(C)
of this section. Note that if a generic DUNS number is used on the
report to FPDS, systems that prepopulate data based on the DUNS
number reported to FPDS may not be able to use the DUNS number for
further reporting on that contract action because the contractor
identification information is not accurately reflected. For example,
assessing officials cannot report past performance reports to the
Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) (see
FAR Subpart <span class="ph FARxref">42.15</span>)
if a generic DUNS number was used to report the action to FPDS.
Additionally, some reporting requirements placed on the contractor,
such as subcontract reporting required by FAR subparts <span class="ph FARxref">4.14</span> and <span class="ph FARxref">19.7</span>, are not able
to be completed. Therefore, it is important that the use of generic
DUNS numbers in reporting to FPDS be rare and only when necessary.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The following generic DUNS numbers
are available for use in contract reporting only if the conditions
in <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 4.605</span>(c)

         <p class="p List2">(7) <em class="ph i">Contract Action Report Status</em>.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(i) The “Status” data element on contract
action reports indicates whether an award is still open or officially
“closed” and applies to the family of actions comprising the contract
or order (i.e., includes all modifications to that contract or order).
Values in this field will either be null (blank), indicating that
the contract is still open; or “Closed,” indicating the contract
or order has completed closeout activities in accordance with <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 4.804</span>, as supplemented. Awards
without the “Closed” status are assumed to still be open and either
still within the established delivery dates or period of performance,
or in a post-performance period preparing for closeout.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(ii) The “Status” is changed to “Closed”
in one of three ways:</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) User reports a modification using “Closeout”
in the “Reason for Modification” field. This should be rare and only
occur when a modification being issued actually closes the award
in that modification (not just prepares for it). If a contract action
report is finalized with “Closeout” as the value, it will no longer
be able to be corrected by the user. Users will need to contact
the FPDS help desk to perform any corrections.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) User with “Closeout” privileges in
FPDS marks the award as closed. This will be rare in DoD; only the
DoD and Service lead system administrators will be given these privileges.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) An agency system sends a “Close” notice
via web services to FPDS.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) When the “Status” is changed to “Closed”
that status is applied to the contract or order and all of its subsequent modifications.
Closed notices received for task, delivery, and call orders placed
under IDCs or agreements do not cause the IDC or agreement to be
closed. Closed notices received for IDCs or agreements do not cause
task, delivery, and call orders placed under them to be closed.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iv) Once a contract or order, and its
modifications, has been marked as “Closed” the user or agency cannot
change the status and will need to contact the FPDS help desk to
remove the status if it was marked in error.</p>
