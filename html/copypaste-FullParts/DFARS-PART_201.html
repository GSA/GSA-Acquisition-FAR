         <p class="p List4">(B) Supplemental numbering is the same

up or (S-70) and up. Parts, subparts, sections, or subsections are
supplemented by the addition of a number of 70 and up. Lower divisions
are supplemented by the addition of a number of (S-70) and up. When
text exceeds one paragraph, the subdivisions are numbered using
the <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 1.105-2</span>(b)(2) prescribed sequence,
without skipping a unit. For example, DFARS text supplementing <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 19.501</span> would be numbered 219.501-70.

level does not repeat the numbering sequence. It uses italicized
Arabic numbers and then italicized lower case Roman numerals.</p>

Table 1-1, DFARS Numbering.</p>
         <p class="p List3">(iii) Department/agency and component supplements

supplemental numbering uses subsection numbering of 90 and up, instead
of 70 and up.</p>
