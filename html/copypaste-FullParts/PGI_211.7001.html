for both. If using a separate numbering sequence for internal purchase
requests, procedures shall be in place to ensure that the same number
cannot be assigned to both a MIPR and an internal purchase request.
Use of a purely internal tracking number in addition to the purchase
request number is authorized and supported by the data standards.
Number the purchase request by using—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) The requiring activity’s Department
of Defense Activity Address Code (DODAAC), as described in DLM 4000.25 Volume
6, Chapter 2. DODAACs may be verified at https://www.transactionservices.dla.mil/daasinq.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) A serial number of eight alphanumeric
characters, excluding “I” and “O”; and</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) A revision number, with the original
request being assigned zero and subsequent revisions or amendments
being numbered consecutively.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) Prior to taking action on a purchase
request, contracting officers shall ensure that the requiring activity
has prepared the purchase requests in uniform contract format (see <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 14.201-1</span> and
15.204), except for procurement of construction (see part 36), which
should follow the current edition of the Construction Specifications
Institute format. Purchase requests shall include all supporting
documentation required by local contract procedures.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(c) Prior to taking action on a purchase
request, contracting officers shall ensure that the purchase requests
follow the line item rules and data requirements in DFARS <span class="ph">
               <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS-PART_204.html#DFARS-SUBPART_204.71">SUBPART 204.71 —UNIFORM CONTRACT LINE ITEM NUMBERING SYSTEM</a>
            </span>. Purchase
requests for individual supplies (i.e., not bulk commodities such
as oil) shall identify whether the item to be acquired is subject
to the item unique identification requirements of DFARS <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="DFARS-PART_211.html#DFARS-211.274-2">211.274-2 Policy for item unique identification.</a>.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(d)(1) Purchase requests may be unfunded
for planning purposes, partially funded, or fully funded.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Funding data in purchase requests will,
at a minimum, identify the following elements of the funding source:
Department Code (e.g. 21 Army), Main Account (e.g. 1804, Operation
and Maintenance, Navy), Subaccount (where applicable), and Fiscal
Year. Lists of these codes are published in Supplement 1 to Volume
I of the <em class="ph i">Treasury Financial Manual, Federal Account Symbols and
Titles</em>, generally referred to as <span class="ph">

            <em class="ph i">.</em>
         </p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Agencies shall have sufficient procedures
in place to enable traceability of line items identified in the
purchase request to those in the resulting contract. In developing
such procedures, agencies shall ensure that provisions are made
for circumstances in which the deliverables may be more completely
defined during the process of soliciting offers and making an award.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(e) Contracting officers shall not obligate
funds that have not been certified as currently available and suitable.
All purchase requests shall be reviewed and certified after agreement
on price and prior to award to ensure that the funds are—</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Suitable and available for the purpose
and amount of the contract; and</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Traceable from the purchase request
to the resultant contract.</p>
         <p class="p List1">(f) Purchase requests transmitted between
requiring systems and contract writing systems shall be transmitted
via the Global EXchange system (GEX) using the Purchase Request
Data Standard Extensible Markup Language (XML) format (http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/eb/procurement_data_standard.html).
Copies shall be sent via the GEX to the Electronic Data Access (EDA)
(http://eda.ogden.disa.mil) system. Requiring systems and contract
writing systems may use a format that can be translated to or from
the purchase request Data Standard Extensible Markup Language (XML)
format.</p>
