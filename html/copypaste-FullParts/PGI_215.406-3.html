         <p class="p List2">(11) The contracting officer is responsible
to ensure the approved pre- and post negotiation noncompetitive
business clearance documents (e.g., price negotiation memoranda)
are uploaded into the Contract Business Analysis Repository (CBAR)
at https://eadf.dcma.mil/ewam2/registration/setup.do for the purpose
of sharing negotiation experience with other contracting officers
preparing to negotiate. This includes both noncompetitive actions
using the procedures at FAR part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items,
as well as noncompetitive actions using the procedures at FAR part 15,
Contracting by Negotiation, that are valued in excess of $25 million
and awarded on or after June 24, 2013 (and for all definitized or
awarded actions over $100 million, which occurred on or after October
1, 2012).</p>
         <p class="p List4">(A) Business clearance documents uploaded
to CBAR shall be marked "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO)" at the top
and bottom of the face or cover page, and on the bottom of each
page containing FOUO, including the back page or cover.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(B) The business clearance documents uploaded
to CBAR shall be signed by the contracting officer and shall include all
other signatures required by local policy/procedure.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(C) The documentation shall be uploaded
to CBAR no later than 30 days after award of the contract action
associated with the negotiation and shall include both the prenegotiation
objectives required by <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 15.406-1</span> and
PGI <span class="ph PGIxref">
               <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="PGI_215.406-1.html#DFARS-PGI_PGI_215.406-1">215.406-1</a>
            </span>,
and the record of negotiations (i.e. the Price Negotiation Memoranda
required by <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 15.406-3</span> and PGI <span class="ph PGIxref">
               <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#DFARS-PGI_PGI_215.406-3">215.406-3</a>
            </span>).
The contracting officer shall complete the “description of acquisition”
field with keywords and searchable terms to identify the products
and services acquired. Additionally, the contracting officer shall
complete the “comments” field of the CBAR record to summarize unique
features and aspects of the negotiation in order to prompt other
contracting teams to inquire further to learn from their peers’
prior experience.</p>
         <p class="p List4">(D) If an initial indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity
(IDIQ) task or delivery order contract contemplates issuance of
task or delivery orders that will invoke negotiated rates or values
from the basic contract, then the business clearance record for
the basic IDIQ contract shall be uploaded if the estimated value
of the contract (e.g. ceiling price) exceeds the prescribed dollar
threshold. To the extent individual task or delivery orders entail
a negotiation (i.e. did not simply incorporate prices established
at the basic contract level), a business clearance record for the individual
task or delivery orders that exceed the prescribed dollar thresholds
shall be uploaded to CBAR.</p>
