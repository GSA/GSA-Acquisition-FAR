         <p class="p List2">(1)  This exception permits the requiring department to contract for items of highly unstable design.  For use of this exception, it must be clearly impractical, both technically and contractually, to refer the acquisition to the acquiring department.  Anticipation that contracting by negotiation will be appropriate, or that a number of design changes may occur during contract performance is not in itself sufficient reason for using this exception.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  This exception also applies to items requiring compatibility testing, provided such testing requires continual contact between industry and the requiring department;</p>
         <p class="p List1">(l)  Containers acquired only with items for which they are designed;</p>
         <p class="p List1">(m)  One-time buy of a noncataloged item.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1)  This exception permits the requiring departments to contract for a nonrecurring requirement for a noncataloged item.  This exception could cover a part or component for a prototype which may be stock numbered at a later date.</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2)  This exception does not permit acquisitions of recurring requirements for an item, based solely on the fact that the item is not stock numbered, nor may it be used to acquire items which have only slightly different characteristics than previously cataloged items.</p>
