         <p class="p List2">(4) The other options in the drop down box apply only to contracts awarded and orders issued on or after October 1, 2006. If the solicitation for the contract contains the provision at <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 52.225-18</span>, Place of Manufacture (or the commercial item equivalent at <span class="ph FARxref">FAR 52.212-3</span>(j)), the contracting officer must review the successful offeror’s response to this provision to select the correct option.</p>

         <p class="p List3">(ii) If the offeror has checked the box “Outside the United States,” enter one of the other options, depending on the predominant reason for acquiring end products manufactured outside the United States. These reasons correspond to the exceptions to the Buy American statute (FAR Subpart <span class="ph FARxref">25.1</span> and DFARS Subpart <span class="ph DFARxref">225.1</span>). Further explanation of these exceptions to the Buy American statute are available at the FAR and DFARS references provided in the long description for each option.</p>
