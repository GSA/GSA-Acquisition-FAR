The term does not include the normal administrative costs of processing the VECP or any increase in instant contract cost or price resulting from negative instant contract savings, except that for use in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="i1064748.html#i1044553">52.248-3</a>, see the definition at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="i1064748.html#i1044553">52.248-3</a>(b).</p>
                     <p class="p" id="i1069469__d2837e97">“Instant contract” means the contract under which the VECP is submitted. It does not include increases in quantities after acceptance of the VECP that are due to contract modifications, exercise of options, or additional orders. If the contract is a multiyear contract, the term does not include quantities funded after VECP acceptance. In a fixed-price contract with prospective price redetermination, the term refers to the period for which firm prices have been established.</p>
                     <p class="p" id="i1069469__d2837e100">“Instant unit cost reduction” means the amount of the decrease in unit cost of performance (without deducting any contractor’s development or implementation costs) resulting from using the VECP on the instant contract. In service contracts, the instant unit cost reduction is normally equal to the number of hours per line-item task saved by using the VECP on the instant contract, multiplied by the appropriate contract labor rate.</p>
                     <p class="p" id="i1069469__d2837e103">“Negative instant contract savings” means the increase in the instant contract cost or price when the acceptance of a VECP results in an excess of the contractor’s allowable development and implementation costs over the product of the instant unit cost reduction multiplied by the number of instant contract units affected.</p>
                     <p class="p" id="i1069469__d2837e107">“Net acquisition savings” means total acquisition savings, including instant, concurrent, and future contract savings, less Government costs.</p>

                  Value engineering is the formal technique by which contractors may (1)voluntarily suggest methods for performing more economically and share in any resulting savings or (2)be required to establish a program to identify and submit to the Government methods for performing more economically. Value engineering attempts to eliminate, without impairing essential functions or characteristics, anything that increases acquisition, operation, or support costs.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li abc H5_abc">
               <p class="p" id="i1069499__d2839e26">

                  There are two value engineering approaches:</p>
               <ol class="ol" type="a" id="i1069499__d2825e32">
                  <li class="li 123 H6_123">
                     <p class="p" id="i1069499__d2839e36">
                        <span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span>
                        
                        
                        
                        The first is an incentive approach in which contractor participation is voluntary and the contractor uses its own resources to develop and submit any value engineering change proposals (VECP’s). The contract provides for sharing of savings and for payment of the contractor’s allowable development and implementation costs only if a VECP is accepted. This voluntary approach should not in itself increase costs to the Government.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="li 123 H6_123">
                     <p class="p" id="i1069499__d2839e45">
                        <span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>
                        
                        
                        
                        The second approach is a mandatory program in which the Government requires and pays for a specific value engineering program effort. The contractor must perform value engineering of the scope and level of effort required by the Government’s program plan and included as a separately priced item of work in the contract Schedule. No value engineering sharing is permitted in architect engineer contracts. All other contracts with a program clause share in savings on accepted VECP’s, but at a lower percentage rate than under the voluntary approach. The objective of this value engineering program requirement is to ensure that the contractor’s value engineering effort is applied to areas of the contract that offer opportunities for considerable savings consistent with the functional requirements of the end item of the contract.</p>

Agencies may prescribe sharing of future contract savings on all future contract units to be delivered under contracts awarded within the sharing period for essentially the same item, even if the scheduled delivery date is outside the sharing period.</p>

                        Acquisition savings may be realized
on the instant contract, concurrent contracts, and future contracts.
The contractor is entitled to a percentage share (see paragraph
(a)(1)) of any net acquisition savings. Net acquisition savings result
when the total of acquisition savings becomes greater than the total
of Government costs and any negative instant contract savings. This
may occur on the instant contract or it may not occur until reductions
have been negotiated on concurrent contracts or until future contract
savings are calculated, either through lump-sum payment or as each
future contract is awarded.</p>
