used in this part-</p>
         <p class="p Body">“Accrued
benefit cost method” means an actuarial cost method under which
units of benefits are assigned to each cost accounting period and
are valued as they accrue; <em class="ph i">i.e.,</em>based
on the services performed by each employee in the period involved. The
measure of normal cost under this method for each cost accounting
period is the present value of the units of benefit deemed to be
credited to employees for service in that period. The measure of
the actuarial accrued liability at a plan’s inception date is the
present value of the units of benefit credited to employees for
service prior to that date. (This method is also known as the unit
credit cost method without salary projection.).</p>
         <p class="p Body">“Accumulating
costs” means collecting cost data in an organized manner, such as
through a system of accounts.</p>
         <p class="p Body">“Actual

         <p class="p Body">“Actuarial
accrued liability” means pension cost attributable, under the actuarial
cost method in use, to years prior to the current period considered
by a particular actuarial valuation. As of such date, the actuarial
accrued liability represents the excess of the present value of
future benefits and administrative expenses over the present value
of future normal costs for all plan participants and beneficiaries.
The excess of the actuarial accrued liability over the actuarial
value of the assets of a pension plan is the unfunded actuarial
liability. The excess of the actuarial value of the assets of a
pension plan over the actuarial accrued liability is an actuarial
surplus and is treated as a negative unfunded actuarial liability.</p>
         <p class="p Body">“Actuarial
assumption” means an estimate of future conditions affecting pension
cost; <em class="ph i">e.g.,</em>mortality rate, employee
turnover, compensation levels, earnings on pension plan assets,
and changes in values of pension plan assets.</p>
         <p class="p Body">“Actuarial
cost method” means a technique which uses actuarial assumptions
to measure the present value of future pension benefits and pension
plan administrative expenses, and that assigns the cost of such
benefits and expenses to cost accounting periods. The actuarial
cost method includes the asset valuation method used to determine
the actuarial value of the assets of a pension plan.</p>
         <p class="p Body">“Actuarial
gain and loss” means the effect on pension cost resulting from differences
between actuarial assumptions and actual experience.</p>
         <p class="p Body">“Actuarial

for personal services” means all remuneration paid currently or
accrued, in whatever form and whether paid immediately or deferred,
for services rendered by employees to the contractor.</p>
         <p class="p Body">“Cost

jobs, capitalized projects, etc.</p>
         <p class="p Body">“Deferred
compensation” means an award made by an employer to compensate an
employee in a future cost accounting period or periods for services
rendered in one or more cost accounting periods before the date
of the receipt of compensation by the employee. This definition
shall not include the amount of year end accruals for salaries,
wages, or bonuses that are to be paid within a reasonable period
of time after the end of a cost accounting period.</p>
         <p class="p Body">“Defined-benefit
pension plan” means a pension plan in which the benefits to be paid,
or the basis for determining such benefits, are established in advance
and the contributions are intended to provide the stated benefits.</p>
         <p class="p Body">“Defined-contribution
pension plan” means a pension plan in which the contributions to

The overall objective is to provide that, to the extent practicable, all organizations of similar types doing similar work will follow the same cost principles and procedures. To achieve this uniformity, individual deviations concerning cost principles require advance approval of the agency head or designee. Class deviations for the civilian agencies require advance approval of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council. Class deviations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration require advance approval of the Deputy Chief Acquisition Officer. Class deviations for the Department of Defense require advance approval of the Director of Defense Procurement, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.</p>

However, costs otherwise unallowable under this part shall not become allowable through the use of any schedule (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1086218">31.109</a>(c)). For example, schedules need to be adjusted for Government contract costing purposes if they are based on replacement cost, include unallowable interest costs, or use improper cost of money rates or computations. Contracting officers should review the computations and factors included within the specified schedule and ensure that unallowable or unacceptably computed factors are not allowed in cost submissions.</p>

                  The extent of allowability of the costs covered in this part applies broadly to many accounting systems in varying contract situations. Thus, the reasonableness, the allocability and the allowability under the specific cost principles at <a class="xref fm:Subparts" href="#i1084539">subparts&nbsp; 31.2</a>, <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1084503">31.3</a>, <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1084403">31.6</a>, and <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1084365">31.7</a> of certain costs may be difficult to determine.

                  Certain cost principles in this subpart incorporate the measurement, assignment, and allocability rules of selected CAS and limit the allowability of costs to the amounts determined using the criteria in those selected standards. Only those CAS or portions of standards specifically made applicable by the cost principles in this subpart are mandatory unless the contract is CAS-covered (see <a class="xref fm:Part" href="i1087414.html#i1087414">part 30</a>). Business units that are not otherwise subject to these standards under a CAS clause are subject to the selected standards only for the purpose of determining allowability of costs on Government contracts. Including the selected standards in the cost principles does not subject the business unit to any other CAS rules and regulations. The applicability of the CAS rules and regulations is determined by the CAS clause, if any, in the contract and the requirements of the standards themselves.</p>

The contracting officer may disallow all or part of a claimed cost that is inadequately supported.</p>

                  A cost is reasonable if, in its nature and amount, it does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of competitive business. Reasonableness of specific costs must be examined with particular care in connection with firms or their separate divisions that may not be subject to effective competitive restraints. No presumption of reasonableness shall be attached to the incurrence of costs by a contractor. If an initial review of the facts results in a challenge of a specific cost by the contracting officer or the contracting officer’s representative, the burden of proof shall be upon the contractor to establish that such cost is reasonable.</p>

                  After direct costs have been determined and charged directly to the contract or other work, indirect costs are those remaining to be allocated to intermediate or two or more final cost objectives.

                  The contractor shall accumulate indirect costs by logical cost groupings with due consideration of the reasons for incurring such costs. The contractor shall determine each grouping so as to permit use of an allocation base that is common to all cost objectives to which the grouping is to be allocated. The base selected shall allocate the grouping on the basis of the benefits accruing to intermediate and final cost objectives. When substantially the same results can be achieved through less precise methods, the number and composition of cost groupings should be governed by practical considerations and should not unduly complicate the allocation.</p>

                  Once an appropriate base for allocating indirect costs has been accepted, the contractor shall not fragment the base by removing individual elements. All items properly includable in an indirect cost base shall bear a pro rata share of indirect costs irrespective of their acceptance as Government contract costs. For example, when a cost input base is used for the allocation of G&amp;A costs, the contractor shall include in the base all items that would properly be part of the cost input base, whether allowable or unallowable, and these items shall bear their pro rata share of G&amp;A costs.</p>

                  Costs for contingencies are generally unallowable for historical costing purposes because such costing deals with costs incurred and recorded on the contractor’s books. However, in some cases, as for example, terminations, a contingency factor may be recognized when it is applicable to a past period to give recognition to minor unsettled factors in the interest of expediting settlement.</p>

                  Depreciation on a contractor’s plant, equipment, and other capital facilities is an allowable contract cost, subject to the limitations contained in this cost principle. For tangible personal property, only estimated residual values that exceed 10 percent of the capitalized cost of the asset need be used in establishing depreciable costs. Where either the declining balance method of depreciation or the class life asset depreciation range system is used, the residual value need not be deducted from capitalized cost to determine depreciable costs. Depreciation cost that would significantly reduce the book value of a tangible capital asset below its residual value is unallowable.</p>
