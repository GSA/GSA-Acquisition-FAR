                  The audit report is advisory only, and is for the TCO to use in negotiating a settlement or issuing a unilateral determination. Government personnel handling audit reports must be careful not to reveal privileged information or information that will jeopardize the negotiation position of the Government, the prime contractor, or a higher tier subcontractor. Consistent with this, and when in the Government’s interest, the TCO may furnish audit reports under paragraph (c) of this section to prime and higher tier subcontractors for their use in settling subcontract settlement proposals.</p>

                  The termination for convenience clauses in 52.249, except the short-form clauses, obligate the prime contractor to assign to the Government, as directed by the TCO, all rights, titles, and interest under any subcontract terminated because of termination of the prime contract. The TCO shall not require the assignment unless it is in the Government’s interest.</p>

                  The termination for convenience clauses (except the short-form clauses) also provide the Government the right, in its discretion, to settle and pay any settlement proposal arising out of the termination of subcontracts. This right does not obligate the Government to settle and pay settlement proposals of subcontractors. As a general rule, the prime contractor is obligated to settle and pay these proposals. However, when the TCO determines that it is in the Government’s interest, the TCO shall, after notifying the contractor, settle the subcontractor’s proposal using the procedures for settlement of prime contracts. An example in which the Government’s interest would be served is when a subcontractor is a sole source and it appears that a delay by the prime contractor in settlement or payment of the subcontractor’s proposal will jeopardize the financial position of the subcontractor. Direct settlements with subcontractors are not encouraged.</p>

                  A settlement should compensate the contractor fairly for the work done and the preparations made for the terminated portions of the contract, including a reasonable allowance for profit. Fair compensation is a matter of judgment and cannot be measured exactly. In a given case, various methods may be equally appropriate for arriving at fair compensation. The use of business judgment, as distinguished from strict accounting principles, is the heart of a settlement.</p>

                  The primary objective is to negotiate a settlement by agreement. The parties may agree upon a total amount to be paid the contractor without agreeing on or segregating the particular elements of costs or profit comprising this amount.</p>
            </li>

                  Cost and accounting data may provide guides, but are not rigid measures, for ascertaining fair compensation. In appropriate cases, costs may be estimated, differences compromised, and doubtful questions settled by agreement. Other types of data, criteria, or standards may furnish equally reliable guides to fair compensation. The amount of recordkeeping, reporting, and accounting related to the settlement of terminated contracts should be kept to a minimum compatible with the reasonable protection of the public interest.</p>

When completed end items, though accepted, are not to be delivered under the contract, the contractor shall include them in the settlement proposal at the contract price, adjusted for any saving of freight or other charges, together with any credits for their purchase, retention, or sale.</p>

                  Subject to the provisions of the
termination clause, the contractor should promptly submit to the
TCO a settlement proposal for the amount claimed because of the
termination. The final settlement proposal must be submitted within
oneyear from the effective date of the termination, unless the period
is extended by the TCO. Termination charges under a single prime
contract involving two or more divisions or units of the prime contractor
may be consolidated and included in a single settlement proposal.</p>

all cost elements including settlements with subcontractors and

detail supported by adequate accounting data. Actual, standard (appropriately
adjusted), or average costs may be used in preparing settlement
proposals if they are determined under generally recognized accounting
principles consistently followed by the contractor. When actual,
standard, or average costs are not reasonably available, estimated
costs may be used if the method of arriving at the estimates is
approved by the TCO. Contractors shall not be required to maintain
unduly elaborate cost accounting systems merely because their contracts

However, if the Government has taken any action that might be construed as a waiver of the contract delivery or performance date, the contracting officer shall send a notice to the contractor setting a new date for the contractor to make delivery or complete performance.

If the termination is predicated upon this type of failure, the contracting officer shall give the contractor written notice specifying the failure and providing a period of 10 days (or longer period as necessary) in which to cure the failure. When appropriate, this notice may be made a part of the notice described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Upon expiration of the 10 days (or longer period), the contracting officer may issue a notice of termination for default unless it is determined that the failure to perform has been cured.

                  Since the surety is liable for damages resulting from the contractor’s default, the surety has certain rights and interests in the completion of the contract work and application of any undisbursed funds. Therefore, the contracting officer must consider carefully the surety’s proposals for completing the contract. The contracting officer must take action on the basis of the Government’s interest, including the possible effect upon the Government’s rights against the surety.</p>

                  The contracting officer should permit surety offers to complete the contract, unless the contracting officer believes that the persons or firms proposed by the surety to complete the work are not competent and qualified or the proposal is not in the best interest of the Government.</p>

                  There may be conflicting demands for the defaulting contractor’s assets, including unpaid prior earnings (retained percentages and unpaid progress estimates). Therefore, the surety may include a “takeover” agreement in its proposal, fixing the surety’s rights to payment from those funds. The contracting officer may (but not before the effective date of termination) enter into a written agreement with the surety. The contracting officer should consider using a tripartite agreement among the Government, the surety, and the defaulting contractor to resolve the defaulting contractor’s residual rights, including assertions to unpaid prior earnings.</p>

         <p class="p Body_Alternate_List1">(a) Your request of ____ (date) is approved, and you are authorized, subject to the limitations of subsection <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1068773">49.108-4</a> and those stated below, to settle, without further approval of the Government, all subcontracts and purchase orders terminated by you as a result of a Government contract being terminated or modified-</p>
         <p class="p Body_Alternate_List2">(1) For the convenience of the Government or</p>
         <p class="p Body_Alternate_List2">(2) Under any other circumstances that may require the Government to bear the cost of their settlement.</p>
         <p class="p Body_Alternate_List1">(b) This authorization does not extend to the disposition of Government-furnished material or articles completed but undelivered under the subcontract or purchase order, as these require screening and approval of disposal actions by the Government, except that allocable completed articles may be disposed of without Government approval or screening if the total amount (at subcontract price) when added to the amount of settlement (as computed below) does not exceed $_____ [<em class="ph i">insert limit of authorization being granted</em>].</p>
         <p class="p Body_Alternate_List1">(c) This authorization is subject to the following conditions and requirements:</p>
         <p class="p Body_Alternate_List2">(1) The amount of the subcontract termination settlement does not exceed $____ [<em class="ph i">insert limit of authorization being granted</em>], computed as follows:</p>
         <p class="p Body_Alternate_List3">(i) Do not deduct advance or partial payments or credits for retention or other disposal of termination inventory allocated to the settlement proposal.</p>
         <p class="p Body_Alternate_List3">(ii) Deduct amounts payable for completed articles or work at the contract price or for the settlement of termination proposals of subcontractors (except those settlements that have not been approved by the Government).</p>
         <p class="p Body_Alternate_List2">(2) Any termination inventory involved has been disposed of under subsection <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1068773">49.108-4</a>, except that screening and Government approval of scrap and salvage determinations are not required.</p>
         <p class="p Body_Alternate_List2">(3) The Contracting Officer may incorporate into each Notice of Termination specific instructions about the disposition of specific items of termination inventory, or the Contracting Officer may, at any time before final settlement, issue specific instructions. These instructions will not affect any disposal action taken by you or your subcontractors before their receipt.</p>
         <p class="p Body_Alternate_List2">(4) The settlements made by you with your subcontractors and suppliers under this authorization, including sales, retention, or other dispositions of property involved in making these settlements, are reimbursable under <a class="xref fm:Part" href="#i1069121">part 49</a> and the Termination clause of the contract, and do not require approval of the Contracting Officer.</p>
         <p class="p Body_Alternate_List2">(5) Any number of separate settlements of $_____ [<em class="ph i">insert limit of authorization granted</em>] or less may be made with a single subcontractor. Settlement proposals that would normally be included in a single proposal; <em class="ph i">e.g.,</em>those based on a series of separate orders for the same item under one contract, should be consolidated whenever possible and shall not be divided to bring them within the authorization.</p>
         <p class="p Body_Alternate_List2">(6) This authorization does not apply if a subcontractor or supplier is affiliated with you. For this purpose, you should consider a contractor to be affiliated with you if you are under common control or if there is any common interest between you by reason of stock ownership, or otherwise, that is sufficient to create a reasonable doubt that the bargaining between you is completely at arm’s length.</p>
         <p class="p Body_Alternate_List2">(7) A representative of this office will, from time to time, review the methods used in negotiating settlements with your subcontractors and will make a selective examination of the settlements made by you. If the review indicates that you are not adequately protecting the Government’s interest, this delegation will be revoked.</p>
