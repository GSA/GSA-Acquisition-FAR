                        “Participating
substantially” means that the official's involvement is of significance
to the matter. Substantial participation requires more than official
responsibility, knowledge, perfunctory involvement, or involvement
on an administrative or peripheral issue. Participation may be substantial
even though it is not determinative of the outcome of a particular
matter. A finding of substantiality should be based not only on
the effort devoted to a matter, but on the importance of the effort.
While a series of peripheral involvements may be insubstantial,
the single act of approving or participating in a critical step
may be substantial. However, the review of procurement documents
solely to determine compliance with regulatory, administrative,
or budgetary procedures, does not constitute substantial participation
in a procurement.</p>

                              As used in paragraph (a)(2) of this section “professional and technical services” are limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional or a technical person are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client’s proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another, are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.</p>
