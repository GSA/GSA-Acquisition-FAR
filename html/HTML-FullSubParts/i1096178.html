                  When a service contract succeeds a contract for performance of the same or similar services, as defined at 29 CFR <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="i1115819.html#i1115819">9.2</a>, at the same location, the successor contractor and its subcontractors are required to offer those service employees that are employed under the predecessor contract, and whose employment will be terminated as a result of the award of the successor contract, a right of first refusal of employment under the contract in positions for which they are qualified.

All applicable laws and Executive orders must be satisfied in tandem with, and if necessary prior to, the requirements of Executive Order 13495 and this subpart.</p>

                  The senior procurement executive of the procuring agency may waive some or all of the provisions of this subpart after determining in writing that the application of this subpart would not serve the purposes of Executive Order 13495 or would impair the ability of the Federal Government to procure services on an economical and efficient basis. Such waivers may be made for a contract, subcontract, or purchase order, or with respect to a class of contracts, subcontracts, or purchase orders. See 29 CFR <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="i1115147.html#i1115147">9.4</a>(d)(4) for regulatory provisions addressing circumstances in which a waiver could or would not be appropriate.

English and Spanish versions of the notice are available on the Department of Labor website at <a class="xref" href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts" target="_blank">http://www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts</a>.</p>

                  The Secretary of Labor has the authority to issue orders prescribing appropriate remedies, including, but not limited to, requiring the successor contractor to offer employment, in positions for which the employees are qualified, to service employees from the predecessor contract and payment of wages lost.

                  After an investigation (see 29 CFR 9.23) and a determination by the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor, that lost wages or other monetary relief is due, the Administrator may direct that so much of the accrued payments due on either the contract or any other contract between the contractor and the Government shall be withheld as are necessary to pay the monies due. Upon the final order of the Secretary of Labor that such monies are due, the Administrator may direct that such withheld funds be transferred to the Department of Labor for disbursement. (See 29 CFR 9.24(c)).</p>
