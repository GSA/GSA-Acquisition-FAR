                  The acceptance paragraph in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="i1063236.html#i1060971">52.212-4</a> is based upon the assumption that the Government will rely on the contractor’s assurances that the commercial item tendered for acceptance conforms to the contract requirements. The Government inspection of commercial items will not prejudice its other rights under the acceptance paragraph. Additionally, although the paragraph does not address the issue of rejection, the Government always has the right to refuse acceptance of nonconforming items. This paragraph is generally appropriate when the Government is acquiring noncomplex commercial items.</p>

                  Other acceptance procedures may be more appropriate for the acquisition of complex commercial items or commercial items used in critical applications. In such cases, the contracting officer shall include alternative inspection procedure(s) in an addendum and ensure these procedures and the postaward remedies adequately protect the interests of the Government. The contracting officer must carefully examine the terms and conditions of any express warranty with regard to the effect it may have on the Government’s available postaward remedies (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1113089">12.404</a>).</p>

                  The acquisition of commercial items under other circumstances such as on an “as is” basis may also require acceptance procedures different from those contained in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="i1063236.html#i1060971">52.212-4</a>. The contracting officer should consider the effect the specific circumstances will have on the acceptance paragraph as well as other paragraphs of the clause.</p>

To the maximum extent practicable, solicitations for commercial items shall require offerors to offer the Government at least the same warranty terms, including offers of extended warranties, offered to the general public in customary commercial practice.
