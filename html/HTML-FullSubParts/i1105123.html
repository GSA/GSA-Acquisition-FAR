                  The contract types are grouped into two broad categories: fixed-price contracts (see <a class="xref fm:Subpart" href="i1104838.html#i1104838">subpart&nbsp; 16.2</a>) and cost-reimbursement contracts (see <a class="xref fm:Subpart" href="i1104629.html#i1104629">subpart&nbsp; 16.3</a>). The specific contract types range from firm-fixed-price, in which the contractor has full responsibility for the performance costs and resulting profit (or loss), to cost-plus-fixed-fee, in which the contractor has minimal responsibility for the performance costs and the negotiated fee (profit) is fixed. In between are the various incentive contracts (see <a class="xref fm:Subpart" href="i1104343.html#i1104343">subpart&nbsp; 16.4</a>), in which the contractor’s responsibility for the performance costs and the profit or fee incentives offered are tailored to the uncertainties involved in contract performance.</p>

                  Selecting the contract type is generally a matter for negotiation and requires the exercise of sound judgment. Negotiating the contract type and negotiating prices are closely related and should be considered together. The objective is to negotiate a contract type and price (or estimated cost and fee) that will result in reasonable contractor risk and provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance.</p>

                  A firm-fixed-price contract, which best utilizes the basic profit motive of business enterprise, shall be used when the risk involved is minimal or can be predicted with an acceptable degree of certainty. However, when a reasonable basis for firm pricing does not exist, other contract types should be considered, and negotiations should be directed toward selecting a contract type (or combination of types) that will appropriately tie profit to contractor performance.</p>

                  In the course of an acquisition program, a series of contracts, or a single long-term contract, changing circumstances may make a different contract type appropriate in later periods than that used at the outset. In particular, contracting officers should avoid protracted use of a cost-reimbursement or time-and-materials contract after experience provides a basis for firmer pricing.</p>

         <span class="ph autonumber">16.104</span> Factors in selecting contract types.</h2>
      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p">There are many factors that the contracting officer should consider in selecting and negotiating the contract type. They include the following:</p>
         <ol class="ol" id="i1105189__d956e16">
            <li class="li">
               <p class="p" id="i1105189__d978e12">
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span>
                  <em class="ph i">Price competition</em>. Normally, effective price competition results in realistic pricing, and a fixed-price contract is ordinarily in the Government’s interest.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
               <p class="p" id="i1105189__d978e19">
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span>
                  <em class="ph i">Price analysis</em>. Price analysis, with or without competition, may provide a basis for selecting the contract type. The degree to which price analysis can provide a realistic pricing standard should be carefully considered. (See <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="i1105894.html#i1106135">15.404-1</a>(b).)</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
               <p class="p" id="i1105189__d978e29">
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span>
                  <em class="ph i">Cost analysis</em>. In the absence of effective price competition and if price analysis is not sufficient, the cost estimates of the offeror and the Government provide the bases for negotiating contract pricing arrangements. It is essential that the uncertainties involved in performance and their possible impact upon costs be identified and evaluated, so that a contract type that places a reasonable degree of cost responsibility upon the contractor can be negotiated.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
               <p class="p" id="i1105189__d978e36">
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span>
                  <em class="ph i">Type and complexity of the requirement</em>. Complex requirements, particularly those unique to the Government, usually result in greater risk assumption by the Government. This is especially true for complex research and development contracts, when performance uncertainties or the likelihood of changes makes it difficult to estimate performance costs in advance. As a requirement recurs or as quantity production begins, the cost risk should shift to the contractor, and a fixed-price contract should be considered.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
               <p class="p" id="i1105189__d978e43">
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span>
                  <em class="ph i">Combining contract types</em>. If the entire contract cannot be firm-fixed-price, the contracting officer shall consider whether or not a portion of the contract can be established on a firm-fixed-price basis.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">
               <p class="p" id="i1105189__d978e50">
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span>
                  <em class="ph i">Urgency of the requirement</em>. If urgency is a primary factor, the Government may choose to assume a greater proportion of risk or it may offer incentives tailored to performance outcomes to ensure timely contract performance.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li">

                  <em class="ph i">Period of performance or length of production run</em>. In times of economic uncertainty, contracts extending over a relatively long period may require economic price adjustment or price redetermination clauses.</p>

               <p class="p" id="i1105189__d978e64">

                  <em class="ph i">Adequacy of the contractor's accounting system</em>. Before agreeing on a contract type other than firm-fixed-price, the contracting officer shall ensure that the contractor’s accounting system will permit timely development of all necessary cost data in the form required by the proposed contract type. This factor may be critical–</p>

                  <em class="ph i">Concurrent contracts</em>. If performance under the proposed contract involves concurrent operations under other contracts, the impact of those contracts, including their pricing arrangements, should be considered.</p>
