                        Areawide contracts generally provide for ordering utility service at rates approved and/or established by a regulatory body and published in a tariff or rate schedule. However, agencies are permitted to negotiate other rates and terms and conditions of service with the supplier (see paragraph (c) of this section). Rates other than those published may require the approval of the regulatory body.</p>

                        Areawide contracts are negotiated with utility service suppliers for the provision of service within the supplier’s franchise territory or service area.</p>

                        Due to the regulated nature of the utility industry, as well as statutory restrictions associated with the procurement of electricity (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1076611">41.201</a>(d)), competition is typically not available within the entire geographical area covered by an areawide contract, although it may be available at specific locations within the utility’s service area.
