                              Generally, the contractor’s obligations under warranties extend to all defects discovered during the warranty period, but do not include damage caused by the Government. When a warranty for the entire item is not advisable, a warranty may be required for a particular aspect of the item that may require special protection (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> installation, components, accessories, subassemblies, preservation, packaging, and packing, etc.).</p>

                              If the Government specifies the design of the end item and its measurements, tolerances, materials, tests, or inspection requirements, the contractor’s obligations for correction of defects shall usually be limited to defects in material and workmanship or failure to conform to specifications. If the Government does not specify the design, the warranty extends also to the usefulness of the design.</p>
