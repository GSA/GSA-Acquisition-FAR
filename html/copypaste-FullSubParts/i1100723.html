                        The purpose of small business set-asides is to award certain acquisitions exclusively to small business concerns. A “set-aside for Start Printed Page 11761small business” is the limiting of an acquisition exclusively for participation by small business concerns.

                  If, before award of a contract involving a total or partial small business set-aside, the contracting officer considers that award would be detrimental to the public interest (e.g., payment of more than a fair market price), the contracting officer may withdraw the small business set-aside, whether it was unilateral or joint. The contracting officer shall initiate a withdrawal of an individual total or partial small business set-aside, by giving written notice to the agency small business specialist and the SBA PCR (or, if a PCR is not assigned, see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="i1101036.html#i1101041">19.402</a>(a)) stating the reasons. In a similar manner, the contracting officer may modify a unilateral or joint class small business set-aside to withdraw one or more individual acquisitions.
