      <div class="body conbody">
         <p class="p">To establish an FFRDC, or change its basic purpose and mission, the sponsor shall ensure the following:</p>
         
            
               <p class="p" id="id1617MD0I0OM__d2276e20"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span>
                  Existing alternative sources for satisfying agency requirements cannot effectively meet the special research or development needs.</p>
            
            
               <p class="p" id="id1617MD0I0OM__d2276e29"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span>
                  The notices required for publication (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="i1120661.html#i1120807">5.205</a>(b)) are placed as required.</p>
            
            
               <p class="p" id="id1617MD0I0OM__d2276e41"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span>
                  There is sufficient Government expertise available to adequately and objectively evaluate the work to be performed by the FFRDC.</p>
            
            
               <p class="p" id="id1617MD0I0OM__d2276e50"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span>
                  The Executive Office of the President, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Washington, DC 20506, is notified.</p>
            
            
               <p class="p" id="id1617MD0I0OM__d2276e59"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span>
                  Controls are established to ensure that the costs of the services being provided to the Government are reasonable.</p>
            
            
               <p class="p" id="id1617MD0I0OM__d2276e69"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span>
                  The basic purpose and mission of the FFRDC is stated clearly enough to enable differentiation between work which should be performed by the FFRDC and that which should be performed by non-FFRDC’s.</p>
            
            
               <p class="p" id="id1617MD0I0OM__d2276e78"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(g)</span>
                  A reasonable continuity in the level of support to the FFRDC is maintained, consistent with the agency’s need for the FFRDC and the terms of the sponsoring agreement.</p>
            
            
               <p class="p" id="id1617MD0I0OM__d2276e87"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(h)</span>
                  The FFRDC is operated, managed, or administered by an autonomous organization or as an identifiably separate operating unit of a parent organization, and is required to operate in the public interest, free from organizational conflict of interest, and to disclose its affairs (as an FFRDC) to the primary sponsor.</p>
            
            
               <p class="p" id="id1617MD0I0OM__d2276e96"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span>
                  Quantity production or manufacturing is not performed unless authorized by legislation.</p>
            
            
               <p class="p" id="id1617MD0I0OM__d2276e105"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                  <span class="ph autonumber">(j)</span>
                  Approval is received from the head of the sponsoring agency.</p>
