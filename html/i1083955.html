                  Advance payments are advances of money by the Government to a prime contractor before, in anticipation of, and for the purpose of complete performance under one or more contracts. They are expected to be liquidated from payments due to the contractor incident to performance of the contracts. Since they are not measured by performance, they differ from partial, progress, or other payments based on the performance or partial performance of a contract. Advance payments may be made to prime contractors for the purpose of making advances to subcontractors.</p>

                  A contractor, subcontractor, or supplier that needs operating funds to perform a contract related to national defense may apply to a financing institution for a loan. If the financing institution is willing to extend credit, but considers a Government guarantee necessary, the institution may apply to the Federal Reserve Bank of its district for the guarantee. Application forms and guidance are available at all Federal Reserve Banks.</p>

         <p class="p Body">The Government recoups progress payments through the deduction of liquidations from payments that would otherwise be due to the contractor for completed contract items. To determine the amount of the liquidation, the contracting officer applies a liquidation rate to the contract price of contract items delivered and accepted. The ordinary method is that the liquidation rate is the same as the progress payment rate. At the beginning of a contract, the contracting officer must use this method.</p>

liquidation rate, the contracting officer may adjust the estimated
cost and the contract price to include the estimated value of any
work authorized but not yet priced and any projected economic adjustments; however,
the contracting officer’s adjustment must not exceed the Government’s
estimate of the price of all authorized work or the funds obligated
for the contract.</p>

In addition, if the contractor fails to disclose an existing encumbrance in the progress payments certification, the ACO should consult with legal counsel concerning possible violation of <a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml;jsessionid=114A3287C7B3359E597506A31FC855B3" target="_blank">31 U.S.C.3729</a>, the False Claims Act.</p>

These are particularly common in information technology acquisitions, but they may apply to any supply or service. For example, computer software and services delivered through the internet (web services) are often subject to license agreements, referred to as End User License Agreements (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or other similar legal instruments or agreements. Many of these agreements contain indemnification clauses that are inconsistent with Federal law and unenforceable, but which could create a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341) if agreed to by the Government.</p>

                        Construction contracts contain special provisions concerning contractor payments to subcontractors, along with special contractor certification requirements. The Office of Management and Budget has determined that these certifications must not be construed as final acceptance of the subcontractor’s performance. The certification in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="i1064748.html#i1049425">52.232-5</a>(c) implements this determination; however, certificates are still acceptable if the contractor deletes paragraph (c)(4) of <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="i1064748.html#i1049425">52.232-5</a> from the certificate.</p>

                        The basis for performance-based payments may be either specifically described events (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>, milestones) or some measurable criterion of performance. Each event or performance criterion that will trigger a finance payment shall be an integral and necessary part of contract performance and shall be identified in the contract, along with a description of what constitutes successful performance of the event or attainment of the performance criterion. The signing of contracts or modifications, the exercise of options, the passage of time, or other such occurrences do not represent meaningful efforts or actions and shall not be identified as events or criteria for performance-based payments. An event need not be a critical event in order to trigger a payment, but the Government must be able to readily verify successful performance of each such event or performance criterion.</p>

In addition, while the contractor is not required to repay previous performance-based payments in the event of a loss for which the Government has assumed the risk, such a loss may prevent the contractor from making the certification required by the Performance-Based Payments clause.</p>
