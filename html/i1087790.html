                  Indefinite-delivery contracts
for equipment rental may require the contractor to furnish equipment
in any of the States. Since leased equipment remains the contractor’s
property, States and local governments impose a wide variety of
property, use, or other taxes on equipment leased to the Government.
The amount of these taxes can vary considerably from jurisdiction
to jurisdiction. See <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1087514">29.401-1</a> for the prescription
of the contract clause to be included in contracts when delivery points
are not known at time of contracting.</p>

                        The North Carolina Sales and Use
Tax Act authorizes counties and incorporated cities and towns to
obtain each year from the Commissioner of Revenue of the State of
North Carolina a refund of sales and use taxes indirectly paid on
building materials, supplies, fixtures, and equipment that become
a part of or are annexed to any building or structure erected, altered,
or repaired for such counties and incorporated cities and towns
in North Carolina. In <em class="ph i">United States</em> v. <em class="ph i">Clayton</em>, 250 F. Supp. 827 (1965),
it was held that the United States is entitled to the benefit of
the refund, but must follow the refund procedure of the Act and
the regulations to recover what it is due.</p>

                        The Act provides that, to receive
the refund, claimants must file, within 6 months after the claimant’s
fiscal year closes, a written request substantiated by such records,
receipts, and information as the Commissioner of Revenue may require.
No refund will be made on an application not filed within the time
allowed and in such manner as the Commissioner may require. The
requirements of the Commissioner are set forth in regulations that
provide that, to substantiate a refund claim for sales or use taxes
paid on purchases of building materials, supplies, fixtures, or
equipment by a contractor, the Government must secure from the contractor
certified statements setting forth the cost of the property purchased
from each vendor and the amount of sales or use taxes paid. In the
event the contractor makes several purchases from the same vendor,
the certified statement must indicate the invoice numbers, the inclusive
dates of the invoices, the total amount of the invoices, and the
sales and use taxes paid. The statement must also include the cost of
any tangible personal property withdrawn from the contractor’s warehouse
stock and the amount of sales or use tax paid by the contractor.
Similar certified statements by subcontractors must be obtained
by the general contractor and furnished to the claimant. Any local
sales or use taxes included in the contractor’s statement must be
shown separately from the State sales or use taxes.</p>

its character as tangible personal property until it is installed
as an ingredient or component part of a construction project in
