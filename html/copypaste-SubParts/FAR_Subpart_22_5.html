                                    The project will involve specialized construction work that is available from only a limited number of contractors or subcontractors.

                                    The agency's need for the project is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that a project labor agreement would be impracticable.

                              Market research indicates that requiring a project labor agreement on the project would substantially reduce the number of potential offerors to such a degree that adequate competition at a fair and reasonable price could not be achieved. (See <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="10.002.html#FAR_10_002">10.002</a>(b)(1) and <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR_Subpart_36_1.html#FAR_36_104">36.104</a>). A likely reduction in the number of potential offerors is not, by itself, sufficient to except a contract from coverage under this authority unless it is coupled with the finding that the reduction would not allow for adequate competition at a fair and reasonable price.

                              Requiring a project labor agreement on the project would otherwise be inconsistent with Federal statutes, regulations, Executive orders, or Presidential memoranda.
