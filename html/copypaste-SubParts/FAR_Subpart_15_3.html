						            Proposal evaluation is an assessment of the proposal and the offeror’s ability to perform the prospective contract successfully. An agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then assess their relative qualities solely on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation. Evaluations may be conducted using any rating method or combination of methods, including color or adjectival ratings, numerical weights, and ordinal rankings. The relative strengths, deficiencies, significant weaknesses, and risks supporting proposal evaluation shall be documented in the contract file.</p>

                        <em class="ph i">Cost or price evaluation</em>. Normally, competition establishes price reasonableness. Therefore, when contracting on a firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment basis, comparison of the proposed prices will usually satisfy the requirement to perform a price analysis, and a cost analysis need not be performed. In limited situations, a cost analysis may be appropriate to establish reasonableness of the otherwise successful offeror's price (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR_Subpart_15_4.html#FAR_15_403_1">15.403-1</a>(c)(1)(i)(C)). When contracting on a cost-reimbursement basis, evaluations shall include a cost realism analysis to determine what the Government should realistically expect to pay for the proposed effort, the offeror's understanding of the work, and the offeror's ability to perform the contract. Cost realism analyses may also be used on fixed-price incentive contracts or, in exceptional cases, on other competitive fixed-price-type contracts (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR_Subpart_15_4.html#FAR_15_404_1">15.404-1</a>(d)(3)). (See <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR_Subpart_37_1.html#FAR_37_115">37.115</a> for uncompensated overtime evaluation.) The contracting officer shall document the cost or price evaluation.</p>

with offerors after establishment of the competitive range</em>.
Negotiations are exchanges, in either a competitive or sole source

with the intent of allowing the offeror to revise its proposal.
These negotiations may include bargaining. Bargaining includes persuasion,
alteration of assumptions and positions, give-and-take, and may
apply to price, schedule, technical requirements, type of contract, or
other terms of a proposed contract. When negotiations are conducted
in a competitive acquisition, they take place after establishment
of the competitive range and are called discussions.</p>

to, or discuss with, each offeror still being considered for award,
deficiencies, significant weaknesses, and adverse past performance
information to which the offeror has not yet had an opportunity
to respond. The contracting officer also is encouraged to discuss
other aspects of the offeror’s proposal that could, in the opinion
of the contracting officer, be altered or explained to enhance materially
the proposal’s potential for award. However, the contracting officer
is not required to discuss every area where the proposal could be

mandatory minimums (in ways that are not integral to the design),
