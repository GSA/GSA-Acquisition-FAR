						            It is the debarring official’s responsibility to determine whether debarment is in the Government’s interest. The debarring official may, in the public interest, debar a contractor for any of the causes in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#FAR_9_406_2">9.406-2</a>, using the procedures in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#FAR_9_406_3">9.406-3</a>. The existence of a cause for debarment, however, does not necessarily require that the contractor be debarred; the seriousness of the contractor’s acts or omissions and any remedial measures or mitigating factors should be considered in making any debarment decision. Before arriving at any debarment decision, the debarring official should consider factors such as the following:</p>

						            The suspending official may, in the public interest, suspend a contractor for any of the causes in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#FAR_9_407_2">9.407-2</a>, using the procedures in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#FAR_9_407_3">9.407-3</a>.</p>

								                Suspension is a serious action to be imposed on the basis of adequate evidence, pending the completion of investigation or legal proceedings, when it has been determined that immediate action is necessary to protect the Government’s interest. In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, agencies should consider how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. This assessment should include an examination of basic documents such as contracts, inspection reports, and correspondence.</p>

								                The existence of a cause for suspension does not necessarily require that the contractor be suspended. The suspending official should consider the seriousness of the contractor’s acts or omissions and may, but is not required to, consider remedial measures or mitigating factors, such as those set forth in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#FAR_9_406_1">9.406-1</a>(a). A contractor has the burden of promptly presenting to the suspending official evidence of remedial measures or mitigating factors when it has reason to know that a cause for suspension exists. The existence or nonexistence of any remedial measures or mitigating factors is not necessarily determinative of a contractor’s present responsibility.</p>
