                        Agencies shall establish procedures governing the debarment decision-making process that are as informal as is practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental fairness. These procedures shall afford the contractor (and any specifically named affiliates) an opportunity to submit, in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to the proposed debarment. If the suspending and debarring official extends the opportunity for the contractor to submit material in opposition, then the official should also give a deadline for submission of materials. The suspending and debarring official may use flexible procedures to allow a contractor to present matters in opposition in person or remotely through appropriate technology; if so, the suspending and debarring official should change the notice in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section to include those flexible procedures.

                        Suspension is a serious action to be imposed on the basis of adequate evidence, pending the completion of an investigation or legal proceedings, when it has been determined that immediate action is necessary to protect the Government's interest. In deciding whether immediate action is necessary to protect the Government's interest, the suspending and debarring official has wide discretion. The suspending and debarring official may infer the necessity for immediate action to protect the Government's interest either from the nature of the circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal Government. In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, agencies should consider how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. This assessment should include an examination of basic documents such as contracts, inspection reports, and correspondence. An indictment or other official findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual and/or legal matters, constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of suspension actions.

                        The existence of a cause for suspension does not necessarily require that the contractor be suspended. The suspending and debarring official should consider the seriousness of the contractor's acts or omissions and may, but is not required to, consider remedial measures, mitigating factors, or aggravating factors, such as those in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#FAR_9_406_1">9.406-1</a>(a). A contractor has the burden of promptly presenting to the suspending and debarring official evidence of remedial measures or mitigating factors when it has reason to know that a cause for suspension exists. The existence or nonexistence of any remedial measures or aggravating or mitigating factors is not necessarily determinative of a contractor's present responsibility.
