						            Multi-year contracting is a special contracting method to acquire known requirements in quantities and total cost not over planned requirements for up to 5 years unless otherwise authorized by statute, even though the total funds ultimately to be obligated may not be available at the time of contract award. This method may be used in sealed bidding or contracting by negotiation.</p>

						            Multi-year contracting is a flexible contracting method applicable to a wide range of acquisitions. The extent to which cancellation terms are used in multi-year contracts will depend on the unique circumstances of each contract. Accordingly, for multi-year contracts, the agency head may authorize modification of the requirements of this subpart and the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR_Subpart_52_2.html#FAR_52_217_2">52.217-2</a>, Cancellation Under Multi-year Contracts.</p>

						            Agency funding of multi-year contracts shall conform to the policies in OMB Circulars A-11 (Preparation and Submission of Budget Estimates) and A-34 (Instructions on Budget Execution) and other applicable guidance regarding the funding of multi-year contracts. As provided by that guidance, the funds obligated for multi-year contracts must be sufficient to cover any potential cancellation and/or termination costs; and multi-year contracts for the acquisition of fixed assets should be fully funded or funded in stages that are economically or programmatically viable.</p>

						            The termination for convenience procedure may apply to any Government contract, including multiyear contracts. As contrasted with cancellation, termination can be effected at any time during the life of the contract (cancellation is effected between fiscal years) and can be for the total quantity or partial quantity (where as cancellation must be for all subsequent fiscal years’ quantities).</p>

								                In determining	cancellation ceilings, the contracting officer must estimate reasonable	preproduction or startup, labor learning, and other nonrecurring	costs to be incurred by an "average" prime contractor or subcontractor,	which would be applicable to, and which normally would be amortized	over, the items or services to be furnished under the multi-year	requirements. Nonrecurring costs include such costs, where applicable,	as plant or equipment relocation or rearrangement, special tooling	and special test equipment, preproduction engineering, initial rework,	initial spoilage, pilot runs, allocable portions of the costs of	facilities to be acquired or established for the conduct of the	work, costs incurred for the assembly, training, and transportation	to and from the job site of a specialized work force, and unrealized labor	learning. They shall not include any costs of labor or materials,	or other expenses (except as indicated above), which might be incurred	for performance of subsequent program year requirements. The total	estimate of the above costs must then be compared with the best	estimate of the contract cost to arrive at a reasonable percentage	or dollar figure. To perform this calculation, the contracting officer	should obtain in-house engineering cost estimates identifying the	detailed recurring and nonrecurring costs, and the effect of labor	learning.</p>
