						            Prior to entering into a contract for information technology, an agency should analyze risks, benefits, and costs. (See <a class="xref fm:Part" href="Part_7.html#FAR_Part_7">part&nbsp; 7</a> for additional information regarding requirements definition.) Reasonable risk taking is appropriate as long as risks are controlled and mitigated.

						            Types of risk may include schedule risk, risk of technical obsolescence, cost risk, risk implicit in a particular contract type, technical feasibility, dependencies between a new project and other projects or systems, the number of simultaneous high risk projects to be monitored, funding availability, and program management risk.</p>

						            Appropriate techniques should be applied to manage and mitigate risk during the acquisition of information technology. Techniques include, but are not limited to: prudent project management; use of modular contracting; thorough acquisition planning tied to budget planning by the program, finance and contracting offices; continuous collection and evaluation of risk-based assessment data; prototyping prior to implementation; post implementation reviews to determine actual project cost, benefits and returns; and focusing on risks and returns using quantifiable measures.</p>

Modular contracting is intended to reduce program risk and to incentivize contractor performance while meeting the Government’s need for timely access to rapidly changing technology. Consistent with the agency’s information technology architecture, agencies should, to the maximum extent practicable, use modular contracting to acquire major systems (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR_Subpart_2_1.html#FAR_2_101">2.101</a>) of information technology.
