         <p class="p">The FAR adjusts statutory acquisition-related dollar thresholds for inflation every 5 years. The statute at 41 U.S.C. 1908 establishes the calculation used to escalate the thresholds. The statute also identifies certain thresholds that must not be escalated. A matrix of the most recent calculations is available at <a class="xref" href="http://www.regulations.gov" target="_blank">http://www.regulations.gov</a> (search FAR Case 2019-013, open the docket folder, and go to the supporting documents file). </p>
