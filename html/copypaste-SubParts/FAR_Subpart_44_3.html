         <p class="p">The objective of a contractor purchasing system review (CPSR) is to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness with which the contractor spends Government funds and complies with Government policy when subcontracting. The review provides the administrative contracting officer (ACO) a basis for granting, withholding, or withdrawing approval of the contractor’s purchasing system.</p>

for a CPSR based on, but not limited to, the past performance of
the contractor, and the volume, complexity and dollar value of subcontracts.
If a contractor’s sales to the Government (excluding competitively
awarded firm-fixed-price and competitively awarded fixed-price with
economic price adjustment contracts and sales of commercial supplies and
commercial services pursuant to 
                     <a class="xref fm:Part" href="Part_12.html#FAR_Part_12">part&nbsp; 12</a>) are expected
to exceed $25 million during the next 12 months, perform a review
to determine if a CPSR is needed. Sales include those represented
by prime contracts, subcontracts under Government prime contracts,
and modifications. Generally, a CPSR is not performed for a specific
contract. The head of the agency responsible for contract administration
may raise or lower the $25 million review level if it is considered
to be in the Government’s best interest.</p>
