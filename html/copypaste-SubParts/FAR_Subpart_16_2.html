for a firm price or, in appropriate cases, an adjustable price.
Fixed-price contracts providing for an adjustable price may include
a ceiling price, a target price (including target cost), or both.
Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the ceiling price or
target price is subject to adjustment only by operation of contract
clauses providing for equitable adjustment or other revision of
the contract price under stated circumstances. The contracting officer
shall use firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment
contracts when acquiring commercial
products and commercial services, except as provided in <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR_Subpart_12_2.html#FAR_12_207">12.207</a>(b).</p>

This contract type places upon the contractor maximum risk and full responsibility for all costs and resulting profit or loss. It provides maximum incentive for the contractor to control costs and perform effectively and imposes a minimum administrative burden upon the contracting parties. The contracting officer may use a firm-fixed-price contract in conjunction with an award-fee incentive (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR_Subpart_16_4.html#FAR_16_404">16.404</a>) and performance or delivery incentives (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR_Subpart_16_4.html#FAR_16_402_2">16.402-2</a> and <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR_Subpart_16_4.html#FAR_16_402_3">16.402-3</a>) when the award fee or incentive is based solely on factors other than cost.
