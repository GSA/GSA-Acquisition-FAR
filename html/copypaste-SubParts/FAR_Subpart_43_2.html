						            Generally, Government contracts contain a changes clause that permits the contracting officer to make unilateral changes, in designated areas, within the general scope of the contract. These are accomplished by issuing written change orders on <a class="xref" href="https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/amendment-solicitationmodification-contract" target="_blank">Standard&nbsp;Form&nbsp;30</a>, Amendment of Solicitation/Modification of Contract (<a class="xref" href="https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/amendment-solicitationmodification-contract" target="_blank">SF&nbsp;30</a>), unless otherwise provided (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR_Subpart_43_3.html#FAR_43_301">43.301</a>).</p>

						            The contractor must continue performance of the contract as changed, except that in cost-reimbursement or incrementally funded contracts the contractor is not obligated to continue performance or incur costs beyond the limits established in the Limitation of Cost or Limitation of Funds clause (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR_Subpart_32_7.html#FAR_32_706_2">32.706-2</a>).</p>

						            Contractors’ accounting systems are seldom designed to segregate the costs of performing changed work.
