                  <span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> The Federal Supply Schedule program
is also known as the GSA Schedules Program or the Multiple Award
Schedule Program. The Federal Supply Schedule program is directed
and managed by GSA and provides Federal agencies (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="8.004.html#FAR_8_004">8.004</a>) with a simplified
process for obtaining commercial
supplies and commercial services at prices associated with
volume buying. Indefinite delivery contracts are awarded to provide
supplies and services at stated prices for given periods of time.
GSA may delegate certain responsibilities to other agencies (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> GSA
has delegated authority to the VA to procure medical supplies under
the VA Federal Supply Schedules program). Orders issued under the
VA Federal Supply Schedule program are covered by this subpart.
Additionally, the Department of Defense (DoD) manages similar systems of
schedule-type contracting for military items; however, DoD systems
are not covered by this subpart.</p>

                  <span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> GSA schedule
contracts require all schedule contractors to publish an "Authorized
Federal Supply Schedule Pricelist" (pricelist). The pricelist contains
all supplies and services offered by a schedule contractor. In addition,
each pricelist contains the pricing and the terms and conditions
pertaining to each Special Item Number that is on schedule. The
schedule contractor is required to provide one copy of its pricelist
to any ordering activity upon request. Also, a copy of the pricelist may
be obtained from the Federal Supply Service by submitting a written
e-mail request to <a class="xref" href="mailto:schedules.infocenter@gsa.gov" target="_blank">schedules.infocenter@gsa.gov</a> or
by telephone at 1-800-488-3111. This subpart, together with the
pricelists, contain necessary information for placing delivery or
task orders with schedule contractors. In addition, the GSA schedule
contracting office issues Federal Supply Schedules publications
that contain a general overview of the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS)
program and address pertinent topics. Ordering activities may request
copies of schedules publications by contacting the Centralized Mailing
List Service through the Internet at <a class="xref" href="http://www.gsa.gov/cmls" target="_blank">http://www.gsa.gov/cmls</a>,
submitting written e-mail requests to <a class="xref" href="mailto:CMLS@gsa.gov" target="_blank">CMLS@gsa.gov</a>; or by completing
GSA Form 457, FSS Publications Mailing List Application, and mailing
it to the GSA Centralized Mailing List Service (7 SM), P.O. Box
6477, Fort Worth, TX 76115. Copies of GSA Form 457 may also be obtained

BPAs and orders placed against a MAS, using the procedures in this subpart, are considered to be issued using full and open competition (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR_Subpart_6_1.html#FAR_6_102">6.102</a>(d)(3)). Therefore, when establishing a BPA (as authorized by <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR_Subpart_13_3.html#FAR_13_303_2">13.303-2</a>(c)(3)), or placing orders under Federal Supply Schedule contracts using the procedures of <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#FAR_8_405">8.405</a>, ordering activities shall not seek competition outside of the Federal Supply Schedules or synopsize the requirement; but see paragraph (g) of this section.</p>

						            Orders placed under schedule contracts may be credited toward the ordering activity’s small business goals. For purposes of reporting an order placed with a small business schedule contractor, an ordering agency may only take credit if the awardee meets a size standard that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System code assigned to the order in accordance with <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR_Subpart_19_1.html#FAR_19_102">19.102</a>(b)(3). Ordering activities should rely on the small business representations made by schedule contractors at the contract level (but see section <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="FAR_Subpart_19_3.html#FAR_19_301_2">19.301-2</a>(b)(2) concerning rerepresentation for an order).</p>

						            Ordering activities may consider socio-economic status when identifying contractor(s) for consideration or competition for award of an order or BPA. At a minimum, ordering activities should consider, if available, at least one small business, veteran-owned small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, women-owned small business, or small disadvantaged business schedule contractor(s). GSA Advantage! and Schedules e-Library at <a class="xref" href="http://www.gsa.gov/fas" target="_blank">http://www.gsa.gov/fas</a> contain information on the small business representations of Schedule contractors.</p>

						            For orders exceeding the micro-purchase threshold, ordering activities should give preference to the items of small business concerns when two or more items at the same delivered price will satisfy the requirement.</p>
