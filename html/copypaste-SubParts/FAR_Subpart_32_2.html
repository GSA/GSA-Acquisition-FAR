is the responsibility of the contractor to provide all resources

contractor’s responsibility. However, in some markets the provision
of financing by the buyer is a commercial practice. In these circumstances,
the contracting officer may include appropriate financing terms

payment financing is payment by the Government to a contractor of
a fixed number of equal interim financing payments prior to delivery
and acceptance of a contract item. The installment payment arrangement
is designed to reduce administrative costs. However, if a contract
will have a large number of deliveries, the administrative costs
may increase to the point where installment payments are not in
the best interests of the Government.</p>
