                  Labor disputes may cause work stoppages that delay the performance of Government contracts. Contracting officers shall impress upon contractors that each contractor shall be held accountable for reasonably avoidable delays. Standard contract clauses dealing with default, excusable delays, etc., do not relieve contractors or subcontractors from the responsibility for delays that are within the contractors’ or their subcontractors’ control. A delay caused by a strike that the contractor or subcontractor could not reasonably prevent can be excused; however, it cannot be excused beyond the point at which a reasonably diligent contractor or subcontractor could have acted to end the strike by actions such as-</p>

                  When an overtime computation discloses underpayments, the responsible contractor or subcontractor must pay the affected employee any unpaid wages and pay liquidated damages to the Government. The contracting officer must assess liquidated damages at the rate specified at 29 CFR 5.5(b)(2) per affected employee for each calendar day on which the employer required or permitted the employee to work in excess of the standard workweek of 40 hours without paying overtime wages required by the statute. In accordance with the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (28 U.S.C. 2461 Note), the Department of Labor adjusts this civil monetary penalty for inflation no later than January 15 each year.</p>

         <p class="p Body">The Department of Labor is responsible for issuing wage determinations reflecting prevailing wages, including fringe benefits. The wage determinations apply only to those laborers and mechanics employed by a contractor upon the site of the work including drivers who transport to or from the site materials and equipment used in the course of contract operations. Determinations are issued for different types of construction, such as building, heavy, highway, and residential (referred to as rate schedules), and apply only to the types of construction designated in the determination.</p>

                        A general wage determination contains prevailing wage rates for the types of construction designated in the determination, and is used in contracts performed within a specified geographical area. General wage determinations contain no expiration date and remain valid until modified, superseded, or canceled by the Department of Labor. Once incorporated in a contract, a general wage determination normally remains effective for the life of the contract, unless the contracting officer exercises an option to extend the term of the contract (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1097917">22.404-12</a>). These determinations shall be used whenever possible. They are issued at the discretion of the Department of Labor either upon receipt of an agency request or on the Department of Labor’s own initiative.</p>

The request for extension shall be supported by a written finding, which shall include a brief statement of factual support, that the extension is necessary and proper in the public interest to prevent injustice or undue hardship or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business. If necessary, the contracting officer shall delay award to permit either receipt of the extension or receipt and processing of a new determination.

(Note the distinction between receipt by the agency (modification is effective) and receipt by the contracting officer, which may occur later.) During the course of the solicitation, the contracting officer shall monitor the WDOL website to determine whether the applicable wage determination has been revised.

                  Each time the contracting officer exercises an option to extend the term of a contract for construction, or a contract that includes substantial and segregable construction work, the contracting officer must modify the contract to incorporate the most current wage determination.</p>

               <ol class="ol" type="a" id="i1097917__d1309e41">

                        The contracting officer may provide the offerors the opportunity to bid or propose separate prices for each option period. The contracting officer must not further adjust the contract price as a result of the incorporation of a new or revised wage determination at the exercise of each option to extend the term of the contract. Generally, this method is used in construction-only contracts (with options to extend the term) that are not expected to exceed a total of 3 years.</p>

                        The contracting officer may include in the contract a separately specified pricing method that permits an adjustment to the contract price or contract labor unit price at the exercise of each option to extend the term of the contract. At the time of option exercise, the contracting officer must incorporate a new wage determination into the contract, and must apply the specific pricing method to calculate the contract price adjustment. An example of a contract pricing method that the contracting officer might separately specify is incorporation in the solicitation and resulting contract of the pricing data from an annually published unit pricing book <em class="ph i">(e.g.</em>, the U.S. Army Computer-Aided Cost Estimating System or similar commercial product), which is multiplied in the contract by a factor proposed by the contractor (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>, .95 or 1.1). At option exercise, the contracting officer incorporates the pricing data from the latest annual edition of the unit pricing book, multiplied by the factor agreed to in the basic contract. The contracting officer must not further adjust the contract price as a result of the incorporation of the new or revised wage determination.</p>

                        The contracting officer may provide for a contract price adjustment based solely on a percentage rate determined by the contracting officer using a published economic indicator incorporated into the solicitation and resulting contract. At the exercise of each option to extend the term of the contract, the contracting officer will apply the percentage rate, based on the economic indicator, to the portion of the contract price or contract unit price designated in the contract clause as labor costs subject to the provisions of the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute. The contracting officer must insert 50 percent as the estimated portion of the contract price that is labor unless the contracting officer determines, prior to issuance of the solicitation, that a different percentage is more appropriate for a particular contract or requirement. This percentage adjustment to the designated labor costs must be the only adjustment made to cover increases in wages and/or benefits resulting from the incorporation of a new or revised wage determination at the exercise of the option.</p>

                        The contracting officer may provide a computation method to adjust the contract price to reflect the contractor’s actual increase or decrease in wages and fringe benefits (combined) to the extent that the increase is made to comply with, or the decrease is voluntarily made by the contractor as a result of incorporation of, a new or revised wage determination at the exercise of the option to extend the term of the contract. Generally, this method is appropriate for use only if contract requirements are predominately services subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute and the construction requirements are substantial and segregable. The methods used to adjust the contract price for the service requirements and the construction requirements would be similar.</p>

In these cases, the hourly cash equivalent of the cost of these items shall be determined by dividing the employer’s contributions or costs by the employee’s hours worked during the period covered by the costs or contributions. For example, if a contractor pays a monthly health insurance premium of $112 for a particular employee who worked 125 hours during the month, the hourly cash equivalent is determined by dividing $112 by 125 hours, which equals $0.90 per hour. Similarly, the calculation of hourly cash equivalent for nine paid holidays peryear for an employee with a hourly rate of pay of $5.00 is determined by multiplying $5.00 by 72 (9 days at 8 hours each), and dividing the result of $360 by the number of hours worked by the employee during the year. If the interested parties (contractor, contracting officer, and employees or their representative) cannot agree on the cash equivalent, the contracting officer shall submit the question for final determination to the Department of Labor as prescribed by agency procedures.

                  The Secretary of Labor may provide reasonable limitations and may make rules and regulations allowing reasonable variations, tolerances, and exemptions to and from any or all provisions of the Service Contract Labor Standards statute other than <a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml;jsessionid=114A3287C7B3359E597506A31FC855B3" target="_blank">41 U.S.C.6707(f)</a>. These will be made only in special circumstances where it has been determined that the limitation, variation, tolerance, or exemption is necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid the serious impairment of Government business, and is in accord with the remedial purpose of the Service Contract Labor Standards statute to protect prevailing labor standards (<a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml;jsessionid=114A3287C7B3359E597506A31FC855B3" target="_blank">41 U.S.C.6707(b)</a>).

level of skill comparison) between the unlisted classifications
and the classifications listed in the determination (see paragraph
(c) of the clause at <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="i1064748.html#i52_222_41">52.222-41</a>, Service Contract Labor

Request For Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate.
The contracting officer shall review the proposed classification
and rate and promptly submit the completed <a class="xref" href="https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/request-authorization-additional-classification-and-rate" target="_blank">SF&nbsp;1444</a>(which
must include information regarding the agreement or disagreement
of the employees’ representative or the employees themselves together

request, the Wage and Hour Division will (1) approve, modify, or
disapprove the request when the parties are in agreement or (2)
render a final determination in the event of disagreement among
the parties. If the Wage and Hour Division will require more than

                  Some wage determinations will
list a series of classes within a job classification family, for
example, Computer Operators, level I, II, and III, or Electronic
Technicians, level I, II, and III, or Clerk Typist, level I and
II. Generally, level I is the lowest level. It is the entry level,
and establishment of a lower level through conformance is not permissible.
Further, trainee classifications may not be conformed. Helpers in
skilled maintenance trades (for example, electricians, machinists, and
automobile mechanics) whose duties constitute, in fact, separate
and distinct jobs may also be used if listed on the wage determination,
but may not be conformed. Conformance may not be used to artificially
split or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.
However, conforming procedures may be used if the work which an
employee performs under the contract is not within the scope of
any classification listed on the wage determination, regardless
of job title. (See 29 CFR 4.152.)</p>

                  When a service contract succeeds a contract for performance of the same or similar services, as defined at 29 CFR 9.2, at the same location, the successor contractor and its subcontractors are required to offer those service employees that are employed under the predecessor contract, and whose employment will be terminated as a result of the award of the successor contract, a right of first refusal of employment under the contract in positions for which they are qualified.

Such waivers may be made for a contract, subcontract, or purchase order, or with respect to a class of contracts, subcontracts, or purchase orders. See 29 CFR 9.4(d)(4) for regulatory provisions addressing circumstances in which a waiver could or would not be appropriate. The waiver must be reflected in a written analysis as described in 29 CFR 9.4(d)(4)(i) and must be completed by the contract solicitation date, or the waiver is inoperative. The senior procurement executive shall not redelegate this waiver authority.</p>

adjustment only after the effective date of a new annual E.O. minimum wage
determination published pursuant to paragraph (a). Prices will be
adjusted only for increased labor costs (including subcontractor
labor costs) as a result of the annual E.O. minimum wage, and for
associated labor costs (including those for subcontractors). Associated
labor costs shall include increases or decreases that result from
changes in social security and unemployment taxes and workers’ compensation
insurance, but will not otherwise include any amount for general
and administrative costs, overhead, or profit.</p>
