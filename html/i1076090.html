                  For contractors other than educational institutions and nonprofit organizations, the cognizant Federal agency normally will be the agency with the largest dollar amount of negotiated contracts, including options. For educational institutions (defined as institutions of higher education in the OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, subpart A, and <a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml;jsessionid=114A3287C7B3359E597506A31FC855B3" target="_blank">20 U .S.C. 1001</a>) and nonprofit organizations (as defined in the OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200), the cognizant Federal agency for indirect costs is established according to the OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, appendices III and IV, respectively.</p>

                  Once a Federal agency assumes cognizance for a contractor, it should remain cognizant for at least 5 years to ensure continuity and ease of administration. If, at the end of the 5-year period, another agency has the largest dollar amount of negotiated contracts, including options, the two agencies shall coordinate and determine which will assume cognizance. However, if circumstances warrant it and the affected agencies agree, cognizance may transfer prior to the expiration of the 5-year period.</p>

                  Normally, for contractors other than educational institutions and nonprofit organizations, the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) is the responsible Government audit agency. However, there may be instances where an agency other than DCAA desires cognizance of a particular contractor. In those instances, the two agencies shall agree on the most efficient and economical approach to meet contract audit requirements.

                  A postaward orientation aids both Government and contractor personnel to (1)achieve a clear and mutual understanding of all contract requirements, and (2)identify and resolve potential problems. However, it is not a substitute for the contractor’s fully understanding the work requirements at the time offers are submitted, nor is it to be used to alter the final agreement arrived at in any negotiations leading to contract award.</p>

                  The contracting officer (or cognizant Federal agency official) or auditor shall establish billing rates on the basis of information resulting from recent review, previous rate audits or experience, or similar reliable data or experience of other contracting activities. In establishing billing rates, the contracting officer (or cognizant Federal agency official) or auditor should ensure that the billing rates are as close as possible to the final indirect cost rates anticipated for the contractor’s fiscal period, as adjusted for any unallowable costs. When the contracting officer (or cognizant Federal agency official) or auditor determines that the dollar value of contracts requiring use of billing rates does not warrant submission of a detailed billing rate proposal, the billing rates may be established by making appropriate adjustments from the prior year’s indirect cost experience to eliminate unallowable and nonrecurring costs and to reflect new or changed conditions.</p>

                  Once established, billing rates may be prospectively or retroactively revised by mutual agreement of the contracting officer (or cognizant Federal agency official) or auditor and the contractor at either party’s request, to prevent substantial overpayment or underpayment. When agreement cannot be reached, the billing rates may be unilaterally determined by the contracting officer (or cognizant Federal agency official).</p>

                  A novation agreement is unnecessary when there is a change in the ownership of a contractor as a result of a stock purchase, with no legal change in the contracting party, and when that contracting party remains in control of the assets and is the party performing the contract. However, whether there is a purchase of assets or a stock purchase, there may be issues related to the change in ownership that appropriately should be addressed in a formal agreement between the contractor and the Government (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="#i1074602">42.1203</a>(e)).</p>

               <p class="p" id="i1074655__d2550e386">(a) The parties agree to the following facts:</p>
               <p class="p" id="i1074655__d2550e389">(1) The Government, represented by various Contracting Officers of the ______________ [<em class="ph i">insert name(s) of agency(ies)</em>], has entered into certain contracts with the Transferor, namely: ____________ [<em class="ph i">insert contract or purchase order identifications</em>]; [<em class="ph i">or delete “namely” and insert “as shown in the attached list marked ‘Exhibit A’ and incorporated in this Agreement by reference.”</em>]. The term “the contracts,” as used in this Agreement, means the above contracts and purchase orders and all other contracts and purchase orders, including all modifications, made between the Government and the Transferor before the effective date of this Agreement (whether or not performance and payment have been completed and releases executed if the Government or the Transferor has any remaining rights, duties, or obligations under these contracts and purchase orders). Included in the term “the contracts” are also all modifications made under the terms and conditions of these contracts and purchase orders between the Government and the Transferee, on or after the effective date of this Agreement.</p>
               <p class="p" id="i1074655__d2550e402">(2) As of ____________, 20___, the Transferor has transferred to the Transferee all the assets of the Transferor by virtue of a __________ [<em class="ph i">insert term descriptive of the legal transaction involved</em>] between the Transferor and the Transferee.</p>
               <p class="p" id="i1074655__d2550e408">(3) The Transferee has acquired all the assets of the Transferor by virtue of the above transfer.</p>
               <p class="p" id="i1074655__d2550e411">(4) The Transferee has assumed all obligations and liabilities of the Transferor under the contracts by virtue of the above transfer.</p>
               <p class="p" id="i1074655__d2550e414">(5) The Transferee is in a position to fully perform all obligations that may exist under the contracts.</p>
               <p class="p" id="i1074655__d2550e417">(6) It is consistent with the Government’s interest to recognize the Transferee as the successor party to the contracts.</p>
               <p class="p" id="i1074655__d2550e420">(7) Evidence of the above transfer has been filed with the Government. [<em class="ph i">When a change of name is also involved; e.g.,a prior or concurrent change of the Transferee’s name, an appropriate statement shall be inserted (see example in paragraph(8) of this Agreement)</em>].</p>

               <p class="p" id="i1074655__d2550e439">(2) The Transferee agrees to be bound by and to perform each contract in accordance with the conditions contained in the contracts. The Transferee also assumes all obligations and liabilities of, and all claims against, the Transferor under the contracts as if the Transferee were the original party to the contracts.</p>
               <p class="p" id="i1074655__d2550e442">(3) The Transferee ratifies all previous actions taken by the Transferor with respect to the contracts, with the same force and effect as if the action had been taken by the Transferee.</p>
               <p class="p" id="i1074655__d2550e445">(4) The Government recognizes the Transferee as the Transferor’s successor in interest in and to the contracts. The Transferee by this Agreement becomes entitled to all rights, titles, and interests of the Transferor in and to the contracts as if the Transferee were the original party to the contracts. Following the effective date of this Agreement, the term “Contractor,” as used in the contracts, shall refer to the Transferee.</p>
               <p class="p" id="i1074655__d2550e449">(5) Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, nothing in it shall be construed as a waiver of any rights of the Government against the Transferor.</p>
               <p class="p" id="i1074655__d2550e452">(6) All payments and reimbursements previously made by the Government to the Transferor, and all other previous actions taken by the Government under the contracts, shall be considered to have discharged those parts of the Government’s obligations under the contracts. All payments and reimbursements made by the Government after the date of this Agreement in the name of or to the Transferor shall have the same force and effect as if made to the Transferee, and shall constitute a complete discharge of the Government’s obligations under the contracts, to the extent of the amounts paid or reimbursed.</p>
               <p class="p" id="i1074655__d2550e455">(7) The Transferor and the Transferee agree that the Government is not obligated to pay or reimburse either of them for, or otherwise give effect to, any costs, taxes, or other expenses, or any related increases, directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from the transfer or this Agreement, other than those that the Government in the absence of this transfer or Agreement would have been obligated to pay or reimburse under the terms of the contracts.</p>
               <p class="p" id="i1074655__d2550e458">(8) The Transferor guarantees payment of all liabilities and the performance of all obligations that the Transferee-</p>
               <p class="p" id="i1074655__d2550e461">(i) Assumes under this Agreement; or</p>
               <p class="p" id="i1074655__d2550e464">(ii) May undertake in the future should these contracts be modified under their terms and conditions. The Transferor waives notice of, and consents to, any such future modifications.</p>
               <p class="p" id="i1074655__d2550e468">(9) The contracts shall remain in full force and effect, except as modified by this Agreement. Each party has executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.</p>

required for contracts and orders as specified in paragraphs (b) through
(f) of this section, including contracts and orders performed outside
the United States. These evaluations are generally for the entity,

reporting tool for all past performance reports on contracts and
orders. Instructions for submitting evaluations into CPARS are available

Agencies shall prepare an evaluation of contractor performance for
each order that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold that
is placed under a Federal Supply Schedule contract or placed under a
task-order contract or a delivery-order contract awarded by another
agency (<em class="ph i">i.e.</em>, Governmentwide
acquisition contract or multi-agency contract). Agencies placing
orders under their own multiple-agency contract shall also prepare
evaluations for their own orders. This evaluation shall not consider
the requirements under paragraph (g) of this section. Agencies are required
to prepare an evaluation if a modification to the order causes the
dollar amount to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>

For single-agency task-order and delivery-order contracts, the contracting
officer may require performance evaluations for each order in excess
of the simplified acquisition threshold when such evaluations would
produce more useful past performance information for source selection
officials than that contained in the overall contract evaluation
(e.g., when the scope of the basic contract is very broad and the
nature of individual orders could be significantly different). This
evaluation need not consider the requirements under paragraph (g)
of this section unless the contracting officer deems it appropriate.</p>

                  Agency evaluations of contractor
performance, including both negative and positive evaluations, prepared
under this subpart shall be provided to the contractor as soon as
practicable after completion of the evaluation. The contractor will receive
a CPARS-system generated notification when an evaluation is ready
for comment. Contractors shall be afforded up to 14 calendar days
from the date of notification of availability of the past performance
evaluation to submit comments, rebutting statements, or additional
information. Agencies shall provide for review at a level above
the contracting officer to consider disagreements between the parties
regarding the evaluation. The ultimate conclusion on the performance
evaluation is a decision of the contracting agency. Copies of the
evaluation, contractor response, and review comments, if any, shall
be retained as part of the evaluation. These evaluations may be
used to support future award decisions, and should therefore be
marked “Source Selection Information”. Evaluation of Federal Prison
Industries (FPI) performance may be used to support a waiver request
(see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="i1118293.html#i1117175">8.604</a>)
when FPI is a mandatory source in accordance with <a class="xref fm:Subpart" href="i1118293.html#i1117091">subpart 8.6</a>.
The completed evaluation shall not be released to other than Government
personnel and the contractor whose performance is being evaluated
during the period the information may be used to provide source
selection information. Disclosure of such information could cause
harm both to the commercial interest of the Government and to the
competitive position of the contractor being evaluated as well as
impede the efficiency of Government operations. Evaluations used
in determining award or incentive fee payments may also be used
to satisfy the requirements of this subpart. A copy of the annual
or final past performance evaluation shall be provided to the contractor
as soon as it is finalized.</p>

                  Negotiation of forward pricing rate agreements (FPRA’s) may be requested by the contracting officer or the contractor or initiated by the administrative contracting officer (ACO). In determining whether or not to establish such an agreement, the ACO should consider whether the benefits to be derived from the agreement are commensurate with the effort of establishing and monitoring it. Normally, FPRA’s should be negotiated only with contractors having a significant volume of Government contract proposals. The cognizant contract administration agency shall determine whether an FPRA will be established.</p>

                  The ACO shall obtain the contractor’s forward pricing rate proposal and require that it include cost or pricing data that are accurate, complete, and current as of the date of submission (but see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="i1109360.html#i1106547">15.407-3</a>(c)). The ACO shall invite the cognizant contract auditor and contracting offices having a significant interest to participate in developing a Government objective and in the negotiations. Upon completing negotiations, the ACO shall prepare a price negotiation memorandum (PNM) (see <a class="xref fm:ParaNumOnly" href="i1109360.html#i1106411">15.406-3</a>) and forward copies of the PNM and FPRA to the cognizant auditor and to all contracting offices that are known to be affected by the FPRA.</p>

                  The FPRA shall provide specific terms and conditions covering expiration, application, and data requirements for systematic monitoring to ensure the validity of the rates. The agreement shall provide for cancellation at the option of either party and shall require the contractor to submit to the ACO and to the cognizant contract auditor any significant change in cost or pricing data used to support the FPRA.</p>

                  When an FPRA is invalid, the contractor should submit and negotiate a new proposal to reflect the changed conditions. If an FPRA has not been established or has been invalidated, the ACO will issue a forward pricing rate recommendation (FPRR) to buying activities with documentation to assist negotiators. In the absence of an FPRA or FPRR, the ACO shall include support for rates utilized.</p>
