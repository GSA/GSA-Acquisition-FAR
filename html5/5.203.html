that a particular notice has not in fact been published within the
presumed timeframes, contracting officers should consider whether
the date for receipt of offers can be extended or whether circumstances
have become sufficiently compelling to justify proceeding with the

period of time between publication of the synopsis notice and receipt
of offers must be no less than 40 days. However, if the acquisition
falls within a general category identified in an annual forecast,
the availability of which is published, the contracting officer
may reduce this time period to as few as 10 days.</p>
