								                All program years except the first	are subject to cancellation. For each program year subject to cancellation,	the contracting officer shall establish a cancellation ceiling.	Ceilings must exclude amounts for requirements included in prior	program years. The contracting officer shall reduce the cancellation	ceiling for each program year in direct proportion to the remaining	requirements subject to cancellation. For example, consider that	the total nonrecurring costs (see <a class="xref file:/ditatool/gsa/FAR/EditableBranch/dita/17.106-1.ditaxref:1;35:53 fm:ParaNumOnly" href="15.408.html#FAR_15_408">15.408</a>, <a class="xref file:/ditatool/gsa/FAR/EditableBranch/dita/17.106-1.ditaxref:2;38:53 fm:Table" href="15.408.html#FAR_15_408__i1106753">Table&nbsp; 15-2</a>, III. Formats	for Submission of Line Item Summaries C(8)) are estimated at 10	percent of the total multi-year price, and the percentages for each	of the program year requirements for 5 years are (i)30 in the firstyear,	(ii)30 in the second, (iii)20 in the third, (iv)10 in the fourth,	and (v)10 in the fifth. The cancellation percentages, after deducting	3 percent for the first program year, would be 7, 4, 2, and 1 percent	of the total price applicable to the second, third, fourth, and	fifth program years, respectively.</p>

								                In determining	cancellation ceilings, the contracting officer must estimate reasonable	preproduction or startup, labor learning, and other nonrecurring	costs to be incurred by an "average" prime contractor or subcontractor,	which would be applicable to, and which normally would be amortized	over, the items or services to be furnished under the multi-year	requirements. Nonrecurring costs include such costs, where applicable,	as plant or equipment relocation or rearrangement, special tooling	and special test equipment, preproduction engineering, initial rework,	initial spoilage, pilot runs, allocable portions of the costs of	facilities to be acquired or established for the conduct of the	work, costs incurred for the assembly, training, and transportation	to and from the job site of a specialized work force, and unrealized labor	learning. They shall not include any costs of labor or materials,	or other expenses (except as indicated above), which might be incurred	for performance of subsequent program year requirements. The total	estimate of the above costs must then be compared with the best	estimate of the contract cost to arrive at a reasonable percentage	or dollar figure. To perform this calculation, the contracting officer	should obtain in-house engineering cost estimates identifying the	detailed recurring and nonrecurring costs, and the effect of labor	learning.</p>
