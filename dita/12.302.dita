and clauses established in this subpart are intended to address,
to the maximum extent practicable, commercial market practices for
a wide range of potential Government acquisitions of commercial
products and commercial services. However, because of the broad
range of commercial products
and commercial services acquired by the Government, variations
in commercial practices, and the relative volume of the Government’s
acquisitions in the specific market, contracting officers may, within
the limitations of this subpart, and after conducting appropriate
market research, tailor the provision at <xref href="52.212-1.dita#FAR_52_212_1"
