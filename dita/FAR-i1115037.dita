                   A contractor that gains access
to proprietary information of other companies in performing advisory
and assistance services for the Government must agree with the other
companies to protect their information from unauthorized use or disclosure
for as long as it remains proprietary and refrain from using the
information for any purpose other than that for which it was furnished.
The contracting officer shall obtain copies of these agreements
and ensure that they are properly executed.</p>

                   Contractors also obtain proprietary
and source selection information by acquiring the services of marketing
consultants which, if used in connection with an acquisition, may
give the contractor an unfair competitive advantage. Contractors should
make inquiries of marketing consultants to ensure that the marketing
consultant has provided no unfair competitive advantage.</p>
