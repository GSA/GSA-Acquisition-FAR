Reasonable efforts should be made to resolve controversies prior to the submission of a claim. Agencies are encouraged to use ADR procedures to the maximum extent practicable. Certain factors, however, may make the use of ADR inappropriate (see <xref href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title5-section572(b)&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim"

Agencies may also elect to proceed under the authority and requirements of the ADRA.</p>
