						            Generally, prospective prime contractors are responsible for determining the responsibility of their prospective subcontractors (but see <xref href="9.405.dita#FAR_9_405"

                        class="- topic/xref ">9.405-2</xref> regarding debarred, ineligible, or suspended firms). Determinations of prospective subcontractor responsibility may affect the Government's determination of the prospective prime contractor's responsibility. A prospective contractor may be required to provide written evidence of a proposed subcontractor's responsibility.</p>

						            When it is in the Government’s interest to do so, the contracting officer may directly determine a prospective subcontractor’s responsibility (<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">e.g.,</i> when the prospective contract involves medical supplies, urgent requirements, or substantial subcontracting). In this case, the same standards used to determine a prime contractor’s responsibility shall be used by the Government to determine subcontractor responsibility.</p>
