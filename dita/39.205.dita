burden.</i> When an agency determines the acquisition of ICT conforming
with all the applicable ICT accessibility standards would impose
an undue burden on the agency, compliance with the ICT accessibility
standards is only required to the extent that it would not impose
an undue burden. In determining whether conformance to one or more ICT
accessibility standards would impose an undue burden, an agency
shall consider the extent to which conformance would impose significant
difficulty or expense considering the agency resources available
to the program or component for which the ICT supply or service
is being procured.</p>

alteration.</i> When an agency determines that acquisition of ICT

acquisition is required to conform only to the extent that conformance
will not result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the
ICT.</p>
