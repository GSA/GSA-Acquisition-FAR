for determining when a proposed contract may require CAS coverage
and for including the appropriate notice in the solicitation. The
contracting officer must then ensure that the offeror has made the required
solicitation certifications and that required Disclosure Statements
are submitted. (Also see 48 CFR 9903.201-3 and 9903.202 (FAR Appendix).)</p>

not award a CAS-covered contract until the cognizant Federal agency
official (CFAO) has made a written determination that a required
Disclosure Statement is adequate unless, in order to protect the
Government's interest, the agency head, on a nondelegable basis,
authorizes award without obtaining submission of the required Disclosure
Statement (see 48 CFR 9903.202-2). In this event, the contractor
shall submit the required Disclosure Statement and the CFAO shall
make a determination of adequacy as soon as possible after the award.</p>
