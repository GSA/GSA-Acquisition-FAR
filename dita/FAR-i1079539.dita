						            In addition to evaluation factors for technical competence, the contracting officer shall consider, as appropriate, management capability (including cost management techniques), experience and past performance, subcontracting practices, and any other significant evaluation criteria (<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">e.g.,</i>unrealistically low cost estimates in proposals for cost-reimbursement or fixed-price incentive contracts). Although cost or price is not normally the controlling factor in selecting a contractor to perform R&amp;D, it should not be disregarded in arriving at a selection that best satisfies the Government’s requirement at a fair and reasonable cost.</p>

						            In circumstances when a concern has a new idea or product to discuss that incorporates the results of independent R&amp;D work funded by the concern in the private sector and is of interest to the Government, there should be no hesitancy to discuss it; however, the concern should be warned that the Government will not be obligated by the discussion. Under such circumstances, it may be appropriate to negotiate directly with the concern without competition. Also, see <xref href="FAR-i1105439.dita#i1105439"
