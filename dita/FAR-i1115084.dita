the contractor’s eligibility for future prime contract or subcontract
awards will be restricted or the contractor must agree to some other
restraint, the solicitation shall contain a proposed clause that
specifies both the nature and duration of the proposed restraint.
The contracting officer shall include the clause in the contract,
first negotiating the clause’s final terms with the successful offeror,

shall be limited to a fixed term of reasonable duration, sufficient
to avoid the circumstance of unfair competitive advantage or potential
bias. This period varies. It might end, for example, when the first production
contract using the contractor’s specifications or work statement
is awarded, or it might extend through the entire life of a system
for which the contractor has performed systems engineering and technical
direction. In every case, the restriction shall specify termination
by a specific date or upon the occurrence of an identifiable event.</p>
