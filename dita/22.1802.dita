MOU and deny access to the E-Verify system in accordance with the

If the contractor is suspended or debarred as a result of the MOU
termination, the contractor is not eligible to participate in E-Verify
during the period of its suspension or debarment. If the suspension
or debarment official determines not to suspend or debar the contractor,
then the contractor must reenroll in E-Verify.</p>
