						            The purpose of guaranteed loans; <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">i.e.,</i>to provide for financing based on the borrowerâ€™s recoverable investment in defense production contracts, may also apply to contracts that have been terminated (partially or totally) for the convenience of the Government. Guaranteed loans also may be made before such termination if it is known that termination of particular contracts for the convenience of the Government is about to occur. These loans are expected to provide necessary financing pending termination settlements and payments. They may also finance continuing performance of defense production contracts that are eligible for guaranteed loans.</p>
