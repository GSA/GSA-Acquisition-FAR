contractor drafts complete specifications for nondevelopmental equipment,
it should be eliminated for a reasonable time from competition for
production based on the specifications. This should be done in order
to avoid a situation in which the contractor could draft specifications
favoring its own products or capabilities. In this way the Government
can be assured of getting unbiased advice as to the content of the
specifications and can avoid allegations of favoritism in the award
of production contracts.</p>

                        <ph props="autonumber" class="- topic/ph ">(3)</ph> In development
work, it is normal to select firms that have done the most advanced
work in the field. These firms can be expected to design and develop
around their own prior knowledge. Development contractors can frequently
start production earlier and more knowledgeably than firms that
did not participate in the development, and this can affect the
time and quality of production, both of which are important to the
Government. In many instances the Government may have financed the
development. Thus, while the development contractor has a competitive
advantage, it is an unavoidable one that is not considered unfair;
hence no prohibition should be imposed.</p>
