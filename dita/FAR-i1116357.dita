						            When a preaward survey discloses previous unsatisfactory performance, the surveying activity shall specify the extent to which the prospective contractor plans, or has taken, corrective action. Lack of evidence that past failure to meet contractual requirements was the prospective contractor’s fault does not necessarily indicate satisfactory performance. The narrative shall report any persistent pattern of need for costly and burdensome Government assistance (<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">e.g.,</i>engineering, inspection, or testing) provided in the Government’s interest but not contractually required.</p>

						            When the surveying activity possesses information that supports a recommendation of complete award without an on-site survey and no special areas for investigation have been requested, the surveying activity may provide a short-form preaward survey report. The short-form report shall consist solely of the Preaward Survey of Prospective Contractor (General), <xref href="https://www.gsa.gov/forms-library/pre-award-survey-prospective-contractor-general"
