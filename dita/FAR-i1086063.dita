recognition of differing organizational characteristics, the cost
principles and procedures in the succeeding subparts are grouped

concerns and educational institutions. The overall objective is
to provide that, to the extent practicable, all organizations of
similar types doing similar work will follow the same cost principles
and procedures. To achieve this uniformity, individual deviations
concerning cost principles require advance approval of the agency head
or designee. Class deviations for the civilian agencies require
advance approval of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council. Class
deviations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
require advance approval of the Deputy Chief Acquisition Officer. <ph rev="FAC 2019-02 March 27, 2019" class="- topic/ph ">Class <?FM MARKER [Why] Amend section 31.101 by revising the last sentence.?>deviations for the
