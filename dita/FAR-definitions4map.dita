product means— (1) A product, other than real property,
that is of a type customarily used by the general public or by nongovernmental
entities for purposes other than governmental purposes, and–(i) Has
been sold, leased, or licensed to the general public; or(ii) Has been
offered for sale, lease, or license to the general public;(2) A product

of this definition, except for-(i) Modifications
of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace; or(ii) Minor modifications
of a type not customarily available in the commercial marketplace
made to meet Federal Government requirements. “Minor modifications”
means modifications that do not significantly alter the nongovernmental function
or essential physical characteristics of an item or component, or
change the purpose of a process. Factors to be considered in determining
whether a modification is minor include the value and size of the
modification and the comparative value and size of the final product.
Dollar values and percentages may be used as guideposts, but are
not conclusive evidence that a modification is minor;(4) Any combination
of products meeting the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), or (3)
of this definition that are of a type customarily combined and sold
in combination to the general public;(5) A product,

item, if the procuring agency determines the product was developed
exclusively at private expense and sold in substantial quantities,
on a competitive basis, to multiple State and local governments
