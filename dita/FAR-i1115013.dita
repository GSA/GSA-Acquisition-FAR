a combination of substantially all of the following activities:
determining specifications, identifying and resolving interface
problems, developing test requirements, evaluating test data, and
supervising design. Technical direction includes a combination of
substantially all of the following activities: developing work statements, determining
parameters, directing other contractors’ operations, and resolving
technical controversies. In performing these activities, a contractor
occupies a highly influential and responsible position in determining
a system’s basic concepts and supervising their execution by other
contractors. Therefore this contractor should not be in a position
to make decisions favoring its own products or capabilities.</p>
