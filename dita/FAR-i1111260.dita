                   This
subpart authorizes the use of simplified procedures for the acquisition
of supplies and services in amounts greater than the simplified
acquisition threshold but not exceeding $7 million ($13 million
for acquisitions as described in 13.500(c)), including options,
if the contracting officer reasonably expects, based on the nature
of the supplies or services sought, and on market research, that
offers will include only commercial items. Contracting officers
may use any simplified acquisition procedure in this part, subject
to any specific dollar limitation applicable to the particular procedure.
The purpose of these simplified procedures is to vest contracting
officers with additional procedural discretion and flexibility, so
that commercial item acquisitions in this dollar range may be solicited,
offered, evaluated, and awarded in a simplified manner that maximizes
efficiency and economy and minimizes burden and administrative costs
for both the Government and industry (<xref href="http://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml;jsessionid=114A3287C7B3359E597506A31FC855B3"
