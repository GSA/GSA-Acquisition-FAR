						            If a small business set-aside	acquisition or portion of an acquisition is not awarded, the unilateral	or joint determination to set the acquisition aside is automatically	dissolved for the unawarded portion of the set-aside. The required	supplies and/or services for which no award was made may be acquired	by sealed bidding or negotiation, as appropriate.</p>

						            Before	issuing a solicitation for the items called for in a small business	set-aside that was dissolved, the contracting officer shall ensure	that the delivery schedule is realistic in the light of all relevant	factors, including the capabilities of small business concerns.</p>
