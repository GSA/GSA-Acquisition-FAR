						            Pursuant to Executive Order 13658, the minimum hourly wage rate required to be paid to workers performing on, or in connection with, contracts and subcontracts subject to this subpart is at least $10.10 per hour beginning January 1, 2015, and beginning January 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, an amount determined by the Secretary of Labor. The Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division (the Administrator) will notify the public of the new E.O. minimum wage rate at least 90 days before it is to take effect.
