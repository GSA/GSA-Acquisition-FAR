						            Systems acquisitions normally designated as major are those programs that, as determined by the agency head, (1)are directed at and critical to fulfilling an agency mission need, (2)entail allocating relatively large resources for the particular agency, and (3)warrant special management attention, including specific agency-head decisions. The agency procedures may establish additional criteria, as specified in A-109, for designating major programs system acquisitions.</p>
