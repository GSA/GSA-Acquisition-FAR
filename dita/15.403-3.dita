The fact that a price is included in a catalog does not, in and
of itself, make it fair and reasonable. If the contracting officer
cannot determine whether an offered price is fair and reasonable,
even after obtaining additional data from sources other than the
offeror, then the contracting officer shall require the offeror to
submit data other than certified cost or pricing data to support
further analysis (see <xref href="15.404-1.dita#FAR_15_404_1"

This data may include history of sales to non-governmental and governmental
entities, cost data, or any other information the contracting officer
requires to determine the price is fair and reasonable. Unless an
