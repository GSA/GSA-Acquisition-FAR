			      <p id="d979e13" class="- topic/p ">A fixed-price contract with economic price adjustment may be used when (i)there is serious doubt concerning the stability of market or labor conditions that will exist during an extended period of contract performance, and (ii)contingencies that would otherwise be included in the contract price can be identified and covered separately in the contract. Price adjustments based on established prices should normally be restricted to industry-wide contingencies. Price adjustments based on labor and material costs should be limited to contingencies beyond the contractorâ€™s control. For use of economic price adjustment in sealed bid contracts, see <ph class="- topic/ph ">
