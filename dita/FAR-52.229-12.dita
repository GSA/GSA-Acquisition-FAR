shall include the Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service
Form W-14, Certificate of Foreign Contracting Party Receiving Federal
Procurement Payments, with each voucher or invoice submitted under
this contract throughout the period in which this status is applicable.
The excise tax withholding is applied at the payment level, not
at the contract level. The Contractor should revise each IRS Form
W-14 submission to reflect the exemption (if any) that applies to that
particular invoice, such as a different exemption applying. In the
absence of a completed IRS Form W-14 accompanying a payment request,
the default withholding percentage is 2 percent for the section
5000C withholding for that payment request. Information about IRS
Form W-14 and its separate instructions is available via the internet

from each payment an amount equal to 2 percent multiplied by the
contract ratio. If the Contractor marks box 9 of the IRS Form W-14
(rather than completes Lines 10 through 12), the Contractor must
identify and enter the specific exempt and nonexempt amounts in
Line 15 of the IRS Form W-14; the Government will then withhold
2 percent only from the nonexempt amount. See the IRS Form W-14
