or regulation, deviations from the FAR may be granted as specified
in this subpart when necessary to meet the specific needs and requirements
of each agency. The development and testing of new techniques and
methods of acquisition should not be stifled simply because such
action would require a FAR deviation. The fact that deviation authority
is required should not, of itself, deter agencies in their development
and testing of new techniques and acquisition methods. Refer to <xref href="31.101.dita#FAR_31_101"
