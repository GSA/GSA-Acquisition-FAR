						            An independent Government estimate of the cost of architect-engineer services shall be prepared and furnished to the contracting officer before commencing negotiations for each proposed contract or contract modification expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The estimate shall be prepared on the basis of a detailed analysis of the required work as though the Government were submitting a proposal.</p>

The overall amount of the Governmentâ€™s estimate shall not be disclosed except as permitted by agency regulations.</p>
