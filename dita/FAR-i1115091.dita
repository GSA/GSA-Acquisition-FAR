A agrees to provide systems engineering and technical direction
for the Navy on the powerplant for a group of submarines (<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">i.e.,</i>turbines,
drive shafts, propellers, etc.). Company A should not be allowed
to supply any powerplant components. Company A can, however, supply
components of the submarine unrelated to the powerplant (<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">e.g.,</i>fire
control, navigation, etc.). In this example, the system is the powerplant,
not the submarine, and the ban on supplying components is limited
to those for the system only.</p>

A is the systems engineering and technical direction contractor
for system X. After some progress, but before completion, the system
is canceled. Later, system Y is developed to achieve the same purposes
as system X, but in a fundamentally different fashion. Company B
is the systems engineering and technical direction contractor for
system Y. Company A may supply system Y or its components.</p>

                   Before an
acquisition for information technology is conducted, Company A is
awarded a contract to prepare data system specifications and equipment
performance criteria to be used as the basis for the equipment competition.
Since the specifications are the basis for selection of commercial
hardware, a potential conflict of interest exists. Company A should
be excluded from the initial follow-on information technology hardware
acquisition.</p>

A receives a contract to define the detailed performance characteristics
an agency will require for purchasing rocket fuels. Company A has
not developed the particular fuels. When the definition contract
is awarded, it is clear to both parties that the agency will use
the performance characteristics arrived at to choose competitively
a contractor to develop or produce the fuels. Company A may not
be awarded this follow-on contract.</p>
