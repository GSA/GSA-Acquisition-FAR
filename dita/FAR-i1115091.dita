                   Company A agrees to provide systems
engineering and technical direction for the Navy on the powerplant
for a group of submarines (<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">i.e.,</i>turbines,
drive shafts, propellers, etc.). Company A should not be allowed
to supply any powerplant components. Company A can, however, supply
components of the submarine unrelated to the powerplant (<i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">e.g.,</i>fire control, navigation,
etc.). In this example, the system is the powerplant, not the submarine,
and the ban on supplying components is limited to those for the
system only.</p>

but before completion, the system is canceled. Later, system Y is

different fashion. Company B is the systems engineering and technical
direction contractor for system Y. Company A may supply system Y

technology is conducted, Company A is awarded a contract to prepare
data system specifications and equipment performance criteria to
be used as the basis for the equipment competition. Since the specifications
are the basis for selection of commercial hardware, a potential
conflict of interest exists. Company A should be excluded from the
initial follow-on information technology hardware acquisition.</p>

                   Company A receives a contract

characteristics arrived at to choose competitively a contractor
