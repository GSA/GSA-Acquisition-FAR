required only when the information on hand or readily available
to the contracting officer, including information from commercial
sources, is not sufficient to make a determination regarding responsibility.
In addition, if the contemplated contract will have a fixed price
at or below the simplified acquisition threshold or will involve the
acquisition of commercial
products or commercial services (see <xref href="Part_12.dita#FAR_Part_12"
                        base="i1113784"

                        class="- topic/xref ">part  12</xref>), the contracting
officer should not request a preaward survey unless circumstances
justify its cost.</p>

                  <ph props="autonumber" class="- topic/ph ">(b)</ph> When a cognizant
contract administration office becomes aware of a prospective award
to a contractor about which unfavorable information exists and no
preaward survey has been requested, it shall promptly obtain and
transmit details to the contracting officer.</p>

a preaward survey, the surveying activity shall ascertain whether
the prospective contractor is debarred, suspended, or ineligible
(see <xref href="Subpart_9.4.dita#FAR_Subpart_9_4"
                        base="i1115147"

                        class="- topic/xref ">subpart  9.4</xref>). If
the prospective contractor is debarred, suspended, or ineligible,
the surveying activity shall advise the contracting officer promptly
and not proceed with the preaward survey unless specifically requested
to do so by the contracting officer.</p>
