						            Liquidated damages are not punitive and are not negative performance incentives (see <xref href="16.402-2.dita#FAR_16_402_2"
                        base="i1104460"

                        class="- topic/xref ">16.402-2</xref>). Liquidated damages are used to compensate the Government for probable damages. Therefore, the liquidated damages rate must be a reasonable forecast of just compensation for the harm that is caused by late delivery or untimely performance of the particular contract. Use a maximum amount or a maximum period for assessing liquidated damages if these limits reflect the maximum probable damage to the Government. Also, the contracting officer may use more than one liquidated damages rate when the contracting officer expects the probable damage to the Government to change over the contract period of performance.</p>
            </li>

						            The contracting officer must take all reasonable steps to mitigate liquidated damages. If the contract contains a liquidated damages clause and the contracting officer is considering terminating the contract for default, the contracting officer should seek expeditiously to obtain performance by the contractor or terminate the contract and repurchase (see <xref href="Subpart_49.4.dita#FAR_Subpart_49_4"
                        base="i1067972"
                        outputclass="fm:Subpart"
                        class="- topic/xref ">subpart  49.4</xref>). Prompt contracting officer action will prevent excessive loss to defaulting contractors and protect the interests of the Government.</p>

						            The head of the agency may reduce or waive the amount of liquidated damages assessed under a contract, if the Commissioner, Financial Management Service, or designee approves (see Treasury Order 145-10).</p>
