shall be measured by applying the percentage goals to the total
actual subcontracting dollars or, if a commercial plan is involved,
to the pro rata share of actual subcontracting dollars attributable
to Government contracts covered by the commercial plan. If, at contract
completion or, in the case of a commercial plan, at the close of
the fiscal year for which the plan is applicable, the Contractor
has failed to meet its subcontracting goals and the Contracting
Officer decides in accordance with paragraph (c) of this clause
that the Contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply
with its subcontracting plan
(see 19.705-7), established in accordance with the clause in
this contract entitled "Small Business Subcontracting Plan," the
Contractor shall pay the Government liquidated damages in an amount
stated. The amount of probable damages attributable to the Contractorâ€™s
failure to comply shall be an amount equal to the actual dollar
amount by which the Contractor failed to achieve each subcontract
goal.</p>

exists. If, after consideration of all the pertinent data, the Contracting
Officer finds that the Contractor failed to make a good faith effort
