Reconversion costs are unallowable except for the cost of removing Government property and the restoration or rehabilitation costs caused by such removal. However, in special circumstances where equity so dictates, additional costs may be allowed to the extent agreed upon before costs are incurred. Care should be exercised to avoid duplication through allowance as contingencies, additional profit or fee, or in other contracts.</p>
