                  The contracting officer is responsible
for determining when a proposed contract may require CAS coverage
and for including the appropriate notice in the solicitation. The
contracting officer must then ensure that the offeror has made the required
solicitation certifications and that required Disclosure Statements
are submitted. (Also see <ph outputclass="CFR" class="- topic/ph ">48 CFR 9903.201-3</ph> and
9903.202).Â

                  The contracting
officer shall not award a CAS-covered contract until the cognizant
Federal agency official (CFAO) has made a written determination
that a required Disclosure Statement is adequate unless, in order
to protect the Government's interest, the agency head, on a nondelegable
basis, authorizes award without obtaining submission of the required Disclosure
Statement (see <ph outputclass="CFR" class="- topic/ph ">48 CFR 9903.202-2</ph>).
In this event, the contractor shall submit the required Disclosure
Statement and the CFAO shall make a determination of adequacy as
soon as possible after the award.</p>
