						            The existence of any such encumbrance is a violation of the contractor’s obligations under the contract, and the contracting officer may, if necessary, suspend or reduce payments under the terms of the Performance-Based Payments clause covering failure to comply with a material requirement of the contract. In addition, if the contractor fails to disclose an existing encumbrance in the certification, the contracting officer should consult with legal counsel concerning possible violation of <xref href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title31-section3729&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim"
