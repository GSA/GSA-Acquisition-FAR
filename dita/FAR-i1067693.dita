			      <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(2) Any termination inventory involved has been disposed of under subsection <xref href="FAR-i1068773.dita#i1068773"

			      <p outputclass="List2" class="- topic/p ">(6) This authorization does not apply if a subcontractor or supplier is affiliated with you. For this purpose, you should consider a contractor to be affiliated with you if you are under common control or if there is any common interest between you by reason of stock ownership, or otherwise, that is sufficient to create a reasonable doubt that the bargaining between you is completely at arm’s length.</p>
