than the simplified acquisition threshold must agree in the contract that
small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned
small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business,

opportunity to participate in contract performance consistent with
its efficient performance. It is further the policy of the United
