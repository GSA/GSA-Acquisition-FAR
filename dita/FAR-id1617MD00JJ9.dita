                   Agencies must prescribe procedures
for the handling, storing, and disposing of contract files, in accordance
with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) General
Records Schedule 1.1, Financial Management and Reporting Records.
The Financial Management and Reporting Records can be found at <xref href="http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/grs.html"

These procedures must take into account documents held in all types
of media, including microfilm and various electronic media. Agencies
may change the original medium to facilitate storage as long as
the requirements of <ph class="- topic/ph ">the part,</ph> law,
and other regulations are satisfied. The process used to create
and store records must record and reproduce the original document,
including signatures and other written and graphic images completely,
accurately, and clearly. Data transfer, storage, and retrieval procedures
must protect the original data from alteration. Unless law or other
regulations require signed originals to be kept, they may be destroyed
after the responsible agency official verifies that record copies on
alternate media and copies reproduced from the record copy are accurate,
complete, and clear representations of the originals. When original
documents have been converted to alternate media for storage, the
requirements in <xref href="#id1617MD00JJ9/i1122545"
