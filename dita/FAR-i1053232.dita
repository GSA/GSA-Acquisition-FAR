means a commercially available electronic product designed primarily
for the reception and display of audiovisual signals received from
terrestrial, cable, satellite, Internet Protocol TV (IPTV), or other
digital or analog sources. A TV consists of a tuner/receiver and
a display encased in a single enclosure. The product usually relies
upon a cathode-ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display (LCD), plasma
display, or other display technology. Televisions with computer
capability (e.g., computer input port) may be considered to be a
TV as long as they are marketed and sold to consumers primarily
as televisions.</p>
