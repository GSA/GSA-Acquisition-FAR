financing clause is included at the inception of a contract, there
shall be no separate consideration for the contract financing clause.
The value of the contract financing to the contractor is expected
to be reflected in either (1)a bid or negotiated price that will
be lower than such price would have been in the absence of the contract
financing, or (2) contract terms and conditions, other than price,
that are more beneficial to the Government than they would have
been in the absence of the contract financing. Adequate new consideration
is required for changes to, or the addition of, contract financing
after award.</p>

                  <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">Amount
of new consideration.</i> The contractor may provide new consideration
by monetary or nonmonetary means, provided the value is adequate.
The fair and reasonable consideration should approximate the amount
by which the price would have been less had the contract financing
terms been contained in the initial contract. In the absence of
definite information on this point, the contracting officer should
apply the following criteria in evaluating whether the proposed new
consideration is adequate:</p>
