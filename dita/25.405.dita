         <p class="- topic/p ">Under the Caribbean Basin Trade Initiative, the United States Trade Representative has determined that, for acquisitions covered by the WTO GPA, Caribbean Basin country end products, construction material, and services must be treated as eligible products. In accordance with Section 201 (a)(3) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Implementation Act (Pub. L. 109-53) (<xref href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title19-section4031&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim"

                  format="html">19 U.S.C. 4031</xref>), when the CAFTA-DR agreement enters into force with respect to a country, that country is no longer designated as a beneficiary country for purposes of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, and is therefore no longer included in the definition of "Caribbean Basin country" for purposes of the Caribbean Basin Trade Initiative.</p>
