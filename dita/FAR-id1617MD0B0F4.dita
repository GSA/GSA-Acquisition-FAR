also when commingling of property, type of operation, circumstances
of ownership, or condition of the contract make it necessary for
the protection of the Government. The minimum amounts of insurance
required by this regulation (see <xref href="FAR-i1087951.dita#i1087951"

when a contract is to be performed outside the United States and
its outlying areas. When more than one agency is involved, the agency
responsible for review and approval of a contractor’s insurance
program shall coordinate with other interested agencies before acting
on significant insurance matters.</p>
