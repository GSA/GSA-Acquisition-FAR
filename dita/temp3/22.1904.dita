contractor may request a price adjustment only after the effective
date of a new annual E.O. minimum wage determination published pursuant
to paragraph (a). Prices will be adjusted only for increased labor
costs (including subcontractor labor costs) as a result of the annual
E.O. minimum wage, and for associated labor costs (including those
for subcontractors). Associated labor costs shall include increases
or decreases that result from changes in social security and unemployment
taxes and workers’ compensation insurance, but will not otherwise
include any amount for general and administrative costs, overhead,
or profit.</p>

determination rate under the contract (if the wage rate is applicable
to that worker); or the actual wage currently paid the worker. If
the amount is zero or below, there will be no increase paid for
this worker.</p>
