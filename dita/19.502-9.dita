						            If, before award of a contract involving a total or partial small business set-aside, the contracting officer considers that award would be detrimental to the public interest (e.g., payment of more than a fair market price), the contracting officer may withdraw the small business set-aside, whether it was unilateral or joint. The contracting officer shall initiate a withdrawal of an individual total or partial small business set-aside, by giving written notice to the agency small business specialist and the SBA PCR (or, if a PCR is not assigned, see <xref href="19.402.dita#FAR_19_402"

                        class="- topic/xref ">19.402</xref>(a)) stating the reasons. In a similar manner, the contracting officer may modify a unilateral or joint class small business set-aside to withdraw one or more individual acquisitions.</p>

						            If the agency small business specialist does not agree to a withdrawal or modification, the case shall be promptly referred to the SBA PCR (or, if a PCR is not assigned, see <xref href="19.402.dita#FAR_19_402"
