to the public interest as to mandate performance by Government employees.
This definition is a policy determination, not a legal determination. An
inherently governmental function includes activities that require
either the exercise of discretion in applying Government authority,
or the making of value judgments in making decisions for the Government.
Governmental functions normally fall into two categories: the act
of governing, i.e., the discretionary exercise of Government
authority, and monetary transactions and entitlements.(1) An
inherently governmental function involves, among other things, the
interpretation and execution of the laws of the United States so
as to-(i) Bind the United States to take
or not to take some action by contract, policy, regulation, authorization,
order, or otherwise;(ii) Determine,
protect, and advance United States economic, political, territorial,
property, or other interests by military or diplomatic action, civil
or criminal judicial proceedings, contract management, or otherwise;(iii) Significantly
affect the life, liberty, or property of private persons;(iv) Commission,
appoint, direct, or control officers or employees of the United
States; or(v) Exert ultimate
control over the acquisition, use, or disposition of the property,
real or personal, tangible or intangible, of the United States,
including the collection, control, or disbursement of Federal funds.(2) Inherently
governmental functions do not normally include gathering information
for or providing advice, opinions, recommendations, or ideas to
Government officials. They also do not include functions that are
primarily ministerial and internal in nature, such as building security,
mail operations, operation of cafeterias, housekeeping, facilities
operations and maintenance, warehouse operations, motor vehicle
fleet management operations, or other routine electrical or mechanical
services.</dd>

Acquisition savings include-(1) Instant contract savings, that are the net cost reductions on the contract under which the VECP is submitted and accepted, and that are equal to the instant unit cost reduction multiplied by the number of instant contract units affected by the VECP, less the contractor’s allowable development and implementation costs;(2) Concurrent contract savings, that are net reductions in the prices of other contracts that are definitized and ongoing at the time the VECP is accepted; and(3) Future contract savings, that are the product of the future unit cost reduction multiplied by the number of future contract units in the sharing base. On an instant contract, future contract savings include savings on increases in quantities after VECP acceptance that are due to contract modifications, exercise of options, additional orders, and funding of subsequent year requirements on a multiyear contract.Collateral costs means agency costs of operation, maintenance, logistic support, or Government-furnished property.Collateral savings means those measurable net reductions resulting from a VECP in the agency’s overall projected collateral costs, exclusive of acquisition savings, whether or not the acquisition cost changes.Contracting office includes any contracting office that the acquisition is transferred to, such as another branch of the agency or another agency’s office that is performing a joint acquisition action.Contractor’s development and implementation costs means those costs the contractor incurs on a VECP specifically in developing, testing, preparing, and submitting the VECP, as well as those costs the contractor incurs to make the contractual changes required by Government acceptance of a VECP.Future unit cost reduction means the instant unit cost reduction adjusted as the contracting officer considers necessary for projected learning or changes in quantity during the sharing period. It is calculated at the time the VECP is accepted and applies either-(1) Throughout the sharing period, unless the contracting officer decides that recalculation is necessary because conditions are significantly different from those previously anticipated, or(2) To the calculation of a lump-sum payment, that cannot later be revised.Government costs means those agency costs that result directly from developing and implementing the VECP, such as any net increases in the cost of testing, operations, maintenance, and logistics support. The term does not include the normal administrative costs of processing the VECP or any increase in instant contract cost or price resulting from negative instant contract savings, except that for use in 52.248-3, see the definition at 52.248-3(b).Instant contract means the contract under which the VECP is submitted. It does not include increases in quantities after acceptance of the VECP that are due to contract modifications, exercise of options, or additional orders. If the contract is a multiyear contract, the term does not include quantities funded after VECP acceptance. In a fixed-price contract with prospective price redetermination, the term refers to the period for which firm prices have been established.Instant unit cost reduction means the amount of the decrease in unit cost of performance (without deducting any contractor’s development or implementation costs) resulting from using the VECP on the instant contract. In service contracts, the instant unit cost reduction is normally equal to the number of hours per line-item task saved by using the VECP on the instant contract, multiplied by the appropriate contract labor rate.Negative instant contract savings means the increase in the instant contract cost or price when the acceptance of a VECP results in an excess of the contractor’s allowable development and implementation costs over the product of the instant unit cost reduction multiplied by the number of instant contract units affected.Net acquisition savings means total acquisition savings, including instant, concurrent, and future contract savings, less Government costs.Sharing base means the number of affected end items on contracts of the contracting office accepting the VECP.Sharing period means the period beginning with acceptance of the first unit incorporating the VECP and ending at a calendar date or event determined by the contracting officer for each VECP.Unit means the item or task to which the contracting officer and the contractor agree the VECP applies.Value engineering proposal means, in connection with an A-E contract, a change proposal developed by employees of the Federal Government or contractor value engineering personnel under contract to an agency to provide value engineering services for the contract or program.</dd>

Property no longer needed shall be considered contractor inventory.(ii) For any remaining Contractor-acquired property, the Contractor may purchase the property at the unit acquisition cost if desired or make reasonable efforts to return unused property to the appropriate supplier at fair market value (less, if applicable, a reasonable restocking fee that is consistent with the supplier’s customary practices.)(2)Inventory disposal schedules.(i)  Absent separate contract terms and conditions for property disposition, and provided the property was not reutilized, transferred, or otherwise disposed of, the Contractor, as directed by the Plant Clearance Officer or authorizing official, shall use Standard Form 1428, Inventory Disposal Schedule or electronic equivalent, to identify and report-(A) Government-furnished property that is no longer required for performance of this contract;(B) Contractor-acquired property, to which the Government has obtained title under paragraph (e) of this clause, which is no longer required for performance of that contract; and(C) Termination inventory.(ii) The Contractor may annotate inventory disposal schedules to identify property the Contractor wishes to purchase from the Government, in the event that the property is offered for sale.(iii) Separate inventory disposal schedules are required for aircraft in any condition, flight safety critical aircraft parts, and other items as directed by the Plant Clearance Officer.(iv) The Contractor shall provide the information required by FAR 52.245-1(f)(1)(iii) along with the following:(A) Any additional information that may facilitate understanding of the property’s intended use.(B) For work-in-progress, the estimated percentage of completion.(C) For precious metals in raw or bulk form, the type of metal and estimated weight.(D) For hazardous material or property contaminated with hazardous material, the type of hazardous material.(E) For metals in mill product form, the form, shape, treatment, hardness, temper, specification (commercial or Government) and dimensions (thickness, width and length).(v) Property with the same description, condition code, and reporting location may be grouped in a single line item.(vi) Scrap should be reported by "lot" along with metal content, estimated weight and estimated value.(3)Submission requirements.(i) The Contractor shall submit inventory disposal schedules to the Plant Clearance Officer no later than-(A) 30 days following the Contractor’s determination that a property item is no longer required for performance of this contract;(B) 60 days, or such longer period as may be approved by the Plant Clearance Officer, following completion of contract deliveries or performance; or(C) 120 days, or such longer period as may be approved by the Termination Contracting Officer, following contract termination in whole or in part.(ii) Unless the Plant Clearance Officer determines otherwise, the Contractor need not identify or report production scrap on inventory disposal schedules, and may process and dispose of production scrap in accordance with its own internal scrap procedures. The processing and disposal of other types of Government-owned scrap will be conducted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract or Plant Clearance Officer direction, as appropriate.(4)Corrections. The Plant Clearance Officer may-(i) Reject a schedule for cause (e.g., contains errors, determined to be inaccurate); and(ii) Require the Contractor to correct an inventory disposal schedule.(5)Postsubmission adjustments. The Contractor shall notify the Plant Clearance Officer at least 10 working days in advance of its intent to remove an item from an approved inventory disposal schedule. Upon approval of the Plant Clearance Officer, or upon expiration of the notice period, the Contractor may make the necessary adjustments to the inventory schedule.(6)Storage.(i)  The Contractor shall store the property identified on an inventory disposal schedule pending receipt of disposal instructions. The Government’s failure to furnish disposal instructions within 120 days following acceptance of an inventory disposal schedule may entitle the Contractor to an equitable adjustment for costs incurred to store such property on or after the 121 st day.(ii) The Contractor shall obtain the Plant Clearance Officer’s approval to remove property from the premises where the property is currently located prior to receipt of final disposition instructions. If approval is granted, any costs incurred by the Contractor to transport or store the property shall not increase the price or fee of any Government contract. The storage area shall be appropriate for assuring the property’s physical safety and suitability for use. Approval does not relieve the Contractor of any liability for such property under this contract.(7) Disposition instructions. (i) The Contractor shall prepare for shipment, deliver f.o.b. origin, or dispose of Contractor inventory as directed by the Plant Clearance Officer. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer or by the Plant Clearance Officer, the Contractor shall remove and destroy any markings identifying the property as U.S. Government-owned property prior to its disposal.(ii) The Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to demilitarize the property prior to shipment or disposal. In such cases, the Contractor may be entitled to an equitable adjustment under paragraph (i) of this clause.(8)Disposal proceeds. As directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall credit the net proceeds from the disposal of Contractor inventory to the contract, or to the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts.(9)Subcontractor inventory disposal schedules. The Contractor shall require its Subcontractors to submit inventory disposal schedules to the Contractor in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (j)(3) of this clause.(k)Abandonment of Government property.(1) The Government shall not abandon sensitive property or termination inventory without the Contractor’s written consent.(2) The Government, upon notice to the Contractor, may abandon any nonsensitive property in place, at which time all obligations of the Government regarding such property shall cease.(3) Absent contract terms and conditions to the contrary, the Government may abandon parts removed and replaced from property as a result of normal maintenance actions, or removed from property as a result of the repair, maintenance, overhaul, or modification process.(4) The Government has no obligation to restore or rehabilitate the Contractor’s premises under any circumstances; however, if Government-furnished property is withdrawn or is unsuitable for the intended use, or if other Government property is substituted, then the equitable adjustment under paragraph (i) of this clause may properly include restoration or rehabilitation costs.(l)Communication. All communications under this clause shall be in writing.(m)Contracts outside the United States. If this contract is to be performed outside of the United States and its outlying areas, the words "Government" and "Government-furnished" (wherever they appear in this clause) shall be construed as "United States Government" and "United States Government-furnished," respectively.</dd>
