						            The contract types are grouped into two broad categories: fixed-price contracts (see <xref href="FAR-i1104838.dita#i1104838"

                        class="- topic/xref ">subpart  16.2</xref>) and cost-reimbursement contracts (see <xref href="FAR-i1104629.dita#i1104629"
                        base="i1104629"

                        class="- topic/xref ">subpart  16.3</xref>). The specific contract types range from firm-fixed-price, in which the contractor has full responsibility for the performance costs and resulting profit (or loss), to cost-plus-fixed-fee, in which the contractor has minimal responsibility for the performance costs and the negotiated fee (profit) is fixed. In between are the various incentive contracts (see <xref href="FAR-i1104343.dita#i1104343"
                        base="i1104343"

                        class="- topic/xref ">subpart  16.4</xref>), in which the contractor’s responsibility for the performance costs and the profit or fee incentives offered are tailored to the uncertainties involved in contract performance.</p>
