be evaluated in accordance with the criteria contained in the solicitation.
For many commercial products or commercial services, the criteria
need not be more detailed than technical (capability of the item
offered to meet the agency need), price, and past performance. Technical
capability may be evaluated by how well the proposed products or services
meet the Government requirement instead of predetermined subfactors.
Solicitations for commercial products or commercial services do
not have to contain subfactors for technical capability when the
solicitation adequately describes the intended use of the commercial
product or commercial service. A technical evaluation would normally
include examination of such things as product or service literature,
product samples (if requested), technical features, and warranty
provisions. Past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with
the procedures in section <xref href="13.106.dita#FAR_13_106"
