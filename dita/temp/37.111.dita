Examples of circumstances causing such delays are bid protests and alleged mistakes in bid.

However, these rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance thereunder shall not exceed 6 months.</p>
