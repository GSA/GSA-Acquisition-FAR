						            When contracting other than from	GSA’s Multiple Award Schedule contracts for the acquisition of commercial	computer software, no specific contract clause prescribed in this	subpart need be used, but the contract shall specifically address the	Government’s rights to use, disclose, modify, distribute, and reproduce	the software. Section <xref href="12.212.dita#FAR_12_212"
                        base="i1113592"

The	clause at <xref href="52.227-19.dita#FAR_52_227_19"
                        base="i1052720"

                        class="- topic/xref ">52.227-19</xref>, Commercial	Computer Software License, may be used when there is any confusion	as to whether the Government’s needs are satisfied or whether a	customary commercial license is consistent with Federal law. Additional	or lesser rights may be negotiated using the guidance concerning	restricted rights as set forth in <xref href="27.404-2.dita#FAR_27_404_2"
                        base="i1089187"

                        class="- topic/xref ">52.227-19</xref> are needed,	or lesser rights are to be acquired, they shall be negotiated and	set forth in the contract. This includes any additions to, or limitations	on, the rights set forth in paragraph (b) of the clause at <xref href="52.227-19.dita#FAR_52_227_19"
                        base="i1052720"

                        class="- topic/xref ">52.227-19</xref> when used. Examples	of greater rights may be those necessary for networking purposes	or use of the software from remote terminals communicating with	a host computer where the software is located. If the computer software	is to be acquired with unlimited rights, the contract shall also	so state. In addition, the contract shall adequately describe the	computer programs and/or databases, the media on which it is recorded,	and all the necessary documentation.</p>

						            If the	contract incorporates, makes reference to, or uses a vendor’s standard	commercial lease, license, or purchase agreement, the contracting	officer shall ensure that the agreement is consistent with paragraph (a) of	this subsection. The contracting officer should exercise caution	in accepting a vendor’s terms and conditions, since they may be	directed to commercial sales and may not be appropriate for Government	contracts. Any inconsistencies in a vendor’s standard commercial	agreement shall be addressed in the contract and the contract terms	shall take precedence over the vendor’s standard commercial agreement.	If the clause at <xref href="52.227-19.dita#FAR_52_227_19"
