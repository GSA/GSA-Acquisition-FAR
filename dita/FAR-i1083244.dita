The imputed cost of financing is the sum of the imputed costs of each of the financing payments.</p>

Where the period of proposed financing does not match the periods in the OMB Circular, the interest rate for the period closest to the finance period shall be used. AppendixC is updated yearly, and is available from the Office of Economic Policy in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</p>
