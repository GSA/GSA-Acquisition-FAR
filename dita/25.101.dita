                              Except for an end product
that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination
of both, the cost of domestic components must exceed 55 percent
of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C.
1907, this domestic content test of the Buy American statute has
been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see <xref href="12.505.dita#FAR_12_505"

                              For an end product that
consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination
of both, the cost of foreign iron and steel must constitute less
than 5 percent of the cost of all the components used in the end
product (see the definition of "foreign iron and steel" at <xref href="25.003.dita#FAR_25_003"

                                    class="- topic/xref ">25.003</xref>).
The cost of foreign iron and steel includes but is not limited to
the cost of foreign iron or steel mill products (such as bar, billet,
slab, wire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings utilized in
the manufacture of the end product and a good faith estimate of
the cost of all foreign iron or steel components excluding COTS
fasteners. This domestic content test of the Buy American statute
has not been waived for acquisitions of COTS items in this category,
except for COTS fasteners.
