-leased, or -chartered aircraft are limited to the allowable airfare
described in paragraph (b) of this subsection for the flight destination
unless travel by such aircraft is specifically required by contract
specification, term, or condition, or a higher amount is approved

                   Costs of contractor-owned or

of lease, operation (including personnel), maintenance, depreciation,

extent that the automobiles are used for company business. That
portion of the cost of company-furnished automobiles that relates to
personal use by employees (including transportation to and from
