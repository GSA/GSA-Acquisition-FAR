						            With the consent of the contractor, the TCO or TCOâ€™s concerned may negotiate jointly two or more termination settlement proposals of the same contractor under different contracts, even though the contracts are with different contracting offices or agencies. In such cases, accounting work shall be consolidated to the greatest extent practical. The resulting settlement may be evidenced by one settlement agreement covering all contracts involved or by a separate agreement for each contract involved.</p>
