                   When issuing a solicitation for
supplies expected to exceed the micro-purchase threshold, the contracting
officer must check the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification
as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor (the List) ( <xref href="http://www.dol.gov/ilab/" format="html" scope="external">www.dol.gov/ilab/</xref>) (see <xref href="22.1505.dita#FAR_22_1505"

                        outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly">22.1505</xref>(a)). Appearance
of a product on the List is not a bar to purchase of any such product
mined, produced, or manufactured in the identified country, but
rather is an alert that there is a reasonable basis to believe that
such product may have been mined, produced, or manufactured by forced
or indentured child labor.</p>

                               It
has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured

                   Whenever
a contracting officer has reason to believe that forced or indentured
child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture an end product
furnished pursuant to a contract awarded subject to the certification
required in paragraph (c) of this section, the contracting officer
must refer the matter for investigation by the agency’s Inspector
General, the Attorney General, or the Secretary of the Treasury,
whichever is determined appropriate in accordance with agency procedures,
except to the extent that the end product is from the country listed
in paragraph (b) of this section, under a contract exceeding the
applicable threshold.</p>

remedies in accordance with section <xref href="22.1504.dita#FAR_22_1504"
