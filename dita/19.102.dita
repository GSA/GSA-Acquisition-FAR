                         NAICS codes
are updated by the Office of Management and Budget through its Economic
Classification Policy Committee every five years. New NAICS codes
are not available for use in Federal contracting until SBA publishes corresponding
size standards. NAICS codes are available from the U.S. Census Bureau
at

                        SBA determines the size status of a concern, including its affiliates, as of the date the concern represents that it is small to the contracting officer as part of its initial offer, which includes price.

                        When an agency uses a solicitation for a multiple-award contract that does not require offers for the contract to include price, SBA determines size as of the date of initial offer for the multiple-award contract, whether or not the offer includes price or the price is evaluated.

                         Unless required
to do otherwise by paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, contracting
officers shall assign one NAICS code and corresponding size standard
to all solicitations, contracts, and task and delivery orders. The
contracting officer shall determine the appropriate NAICS code by
classifying the product or service being acquired in the one industry
that best describes the principal purpose of the supply or service
being acquired. Primary consideration is given to the industry descriptions
in the U.S. NAICS Manual, the product or service descriptions in
the solicitation, the relative value and importance of the components
of the requirement making up the end item being procured, and the
function of the goods or services being purchased. A procurement
is usually classified according to the component that accounts for
the greatest percentage of contract value.</p>
