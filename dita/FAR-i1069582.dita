This may occur on the instant contract or it may not occur until reductions have been negotiated on concurrent contracts or until future contract savings are calculated, either through lump-sum payment or as each future contract is awarded.</p>

The Government’s share of savings is determined by subtracting Government costs from instant contract savings and multiplying the result by (1)45 percent for fixed-price contracts or (2)75 percent for cost-reimbursement contracts. Value engineering sharing does not apply to incentive construction contracts.</p>
