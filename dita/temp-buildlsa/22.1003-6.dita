						            Remanufacturing	does not include the repair of damaged or broken equipment which	does not require a complete teardown, overhaul, and rebuild as described	in subparagraphs(a)(1) and (a)(2) of this subsection, or the periodic	and routine maintenance, preservation, care, adjustment, upkeep,	or servicing of equipment to keep it in usable, serviceable, working order.	Such contracts typically are billed on an hourly rate (labor plus	materials and parts) basis. Any contract principally for this type	of work is subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute.	Examples of such work include the following:</p>
