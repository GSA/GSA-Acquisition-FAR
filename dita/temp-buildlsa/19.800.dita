						            Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (<xref href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title15-section637(a)&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim"

                        format="html">15 U.S.C. 637(a)</xref>) established a program that authorizes the Small Business Administration (SBA) to enter into all types of contracts with other agencies and award subcontracts for performing those contracts to firms eligible for program participation. This program is the "8(a) Business Development Program," commonly referred to as the "8(a) program." A small business that is accepted into the 8(a) program is known as a "participant." SBA’s subcontractors are referred to as "8(a) contractors." As used in this subpart, an 8(a) contractor is an 8(a) participant that is currently performing on a Federal contract or order that was set aside for 8(a) participants.</p>

						            Contracts may be awarded to the SBA for performance by eligible 8(a) participants on either a sole source or competitive basis.</p>

						            Acting under the authority of the program, the SBA certifies to an agency that SBA is competent and responsible to perform a specific contract. The contracting officer has the discretion to award the contract to the SBA based upon mutually agreeable terms and conditions.</p>
