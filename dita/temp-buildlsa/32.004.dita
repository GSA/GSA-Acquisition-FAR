         <p class="- topic/p ">The enforceability of contract provisions for security of Government financing in a foreign jurisdiction is dependent upon local law and procedure. Prior to providing contract financing where foreign jurisdictions may become involved, the contracting officer shall ensure the Governmentâ€™s security is enforceable. This may require the provision of additional or different security than that normally provided for in the standard contract clauses.</p>
