minimum wages for certain workers at $10.10 per hour. The E.O. 13658
rate has increased each year since 2015, rising to $11.25 on January
1, 2022. As of January 30, 2022, E.O. 13658 is superseded by E.O. 14026
to the extent that it is inconsistent with E.O. 14026; the minimum
wage rate for certain workers is increased to $15.00 per hour. The
wage rate is subject to annual increases by an amount determined
by the Secretary of Labor. See <xref href="Subpart_22.19.dita#FAR_Subpart_22_19"
