the contracting officer should be aware of customary commercial
products and commercial services and conditions when pricing commercial
products and commercial services. Commercial product and commercial
service prices are affected by factors that include, but are not
limited to, speed of delivery, length and extent of warranty, limitations
of seller’s liability, quantities ordered, length of the performance
period, and specific performance requirements. The contracting officer
must ensure that contract terms, conditions, and prices are commensurate
with the Government’s need.</p>
