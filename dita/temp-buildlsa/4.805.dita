						            Agencies must prescribe	procedures for the handling, storing, and disposing of contract files, in	accordance with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)	General Records Schedule <xref outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly"

These procedures	must take into account documents held in all types of media, including	microfilm and various electronic media. Agencies may change the original	medium to facilitate storage as long as the requirements of the part, law,	and other regulations are satisfied. The process used to create and store	records must record and reproduce the original document, including	signatures and other written and graphic images completely, accurately, and	clearly. Data transfer, storage, and retrieval procedures must protect the	original data from alteration. Unless law or other regulations require	signed originals to be kept, they may be destroyed after the responsible	agency official verifies that record copies on alternate media and copies	reproduced from the record copy are accurate, complete, and clear	representations of the originals. When original documents have been	converted to alternate media for storage, the requirements in Table 4-1 of this section also apply to	the record copies in the alternate media.</p>

						            If administrative records are mixed with program records and cannot be economically segregated, the entire file should be kept for the period of time approved for the program records. Similarly, if documents described in the following table are part of a subject or case file that documents activities that are not described in the table, they should be treated in the same manner as the files of which they are a part.</p>
