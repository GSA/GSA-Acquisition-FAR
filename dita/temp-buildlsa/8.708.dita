						            Shipment is normally under Government bills of lading. However, for small orders, ordering offices may specify other shipment methods.</p>

						            When shipments are under Government bills of lading, the bills of lading may accompany orders or be otherwise furnished promptly. Failure of an ordering office to furnish bills of lading or to designate a method of transportation may result in an excusable delay in delivery.</p>
