wage determination modifications expire on the same day as the original

determination for the primary site of the work in a solicitation

modification of the project wage determination with the date and

or by the date the agency receives actual written notice of the

is effective) and receipt by the contracting officer, which may
occur later.) During the course of the solicitation, the contracting
