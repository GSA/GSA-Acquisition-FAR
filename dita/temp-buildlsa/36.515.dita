This clause may also be inserted in such solicitations and contracts when work performance is expected to last less than 60 days and an unusual situation exists that warrants imposition of the requirements. This clause should not be used in the same contract with clauses covering other management approaches for ensuring that a contractor makes adequate progress.</p>
