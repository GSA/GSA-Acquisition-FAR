SAFETY Act designation and SAFETY Act certification are designed to support effective technologies aimed at preventing, detecting, identifying, or deterring acts of terrorism, or limiting the harm that such acts might otherwise cause, and which also meet other prescribed criteria. For some classes of technologies, DHS may issue a block designation/certification in order to lessen the burdens for filing for SAFETY Act designation or SAFETY Act certifications by not requiring applicants to provide certain information otherwise required and in order to offer expedited review of any application submitted pursuant to a block designation/certification.
