								                The allowability of food and dormitory losses are determined by the following factors:</p>

										                    Losses from operating food and dormitory services are allowable only if the contractor’s objective is to operate such services on a break-even basis.</p>

										                    Losses sustained because food services or lodging accommodations are furnished without charge or at prices or rates which obviously would not be conducive to the accomplishment of the objective in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this subsection are not allowable, except as described in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this subsection.</p>
