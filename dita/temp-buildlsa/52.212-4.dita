the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that
the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice
a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance
under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price
set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended

The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting

In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not
be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services
not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government
for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined
that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default,
