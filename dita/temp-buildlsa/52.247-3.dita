If a Federal office move is intrastate and the contracting officer determines that it is in the Government’s interest not to apply the requirements for holding or obtaining State authority to operate within the State, and to maintain a facility within the State or Commercial zone, delete paragraph (b) of the basic clause and redesignate the remaining paragraphs"(b) and (c)." In the 6 th line of the new paragraph (b), delete the words "paragraphs(a) and (b) above" and replace them with "paragraph (a) of this clause."</p>
