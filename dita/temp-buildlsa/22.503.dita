                  Executive Order (E.O.) 14063, Use of Project Labor Agreements for Federal Construction Projects, requires agencies to use project labor agreements in large-scale construction projects to promote economy and efficiency in the administration and completion of Federal construction projects.

                  When awarding a contract in connection with a large-scale construction project (see <xref href="22.502.dita#FAR_22_502" outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly">22.502</xref>), agencies shall require use of project labor agreements for contractors and subcontractors engaged in construction on the project, unless an exception at <xref href="22.504.dita#FAR_22_504" outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly">22.504</xref>(d) applies.

                        Agencies may consider the following factors in deciding whether the use of a project labor agreement is appropriate for a construction project where the total cost to the Federal Government is less than that for a large-scale construction project:

                              The project will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades.

                              There is a shortage of skilled labor in the region in which the construction project will be sited.

                              Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.

                              Project labor agreements have been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of the project.

                              A project labor agreement will promote the agency's long term program interests, such as facilitating the training of a skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs.
