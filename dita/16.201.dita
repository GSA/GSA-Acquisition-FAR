for a firm price or, in appropriate cases, an adjustable price.
Fixed-price contracts providing for an adjustable price may include
a ceiling price, a target price (including target cost), or both.
Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the ceiling price or
target price is subject to adjustment only by operation of contract
clauses providing for equitable adjustment or other revision of
the contract price under stated circumstances. The contracting officer
shall use firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment
contracts when acquiring commercial
products and commercial services, except as provided in <xref href="12.207.dita#FAR_12_207"
