						            There are two levels of priority for rated orders established by the DPAS, identified by the rating symbols "DO" and "DX". All DO rated orders have equal priority with each other and take preference over unrated orders. All DX rated orders have equal priority with each other and take preference over DO rated and unrated orders (see <ph outputclass="CFR" class="- topic/ph ">15 CFR 700.11</ph>). The DPAS regulation contains provisions concerning the elements of a rated order (see <ph outputclass="CFR" class="- topic/ph ">15 CFR 700.12</ph>); acceptance and rejection of rated orders (see <ph outputclass="CFR" class="- topic/ph ">15 CFR 700.13</ph>); preferential scheduling (see <ph outputclass="CFR" class="- topic/ph ">15 CFR 700.14</ph>); extension of priority ratings (flowdown) (see <ph outputclass="CFR" class="- topic/ph ">15 CFR 700.15</ph>); changes or cancellations of priority ratings and rated orders (see <ph outputclass="CFR" class="- topic/ph ">15 CFR 700.16</ph>); use of rated orders (see <ph outputclass="CFR" class="- topic/ph ">15 CFR 700.17</ph>); and limitations on placing rated orders (see <ph outputclass="CFR" class="- topic/ph ">15 CFR 700.18</ph>).</p>

						            The Delegate Agencies have been given authority by the Department of Commerce to place rated orders in support of approved programs (see Schedule I of the DPAS). Other U.S. Government agencies, Canada, and foreign nations may apply for priority rating authority.</p>
