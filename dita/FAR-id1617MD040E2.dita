Thus, the successor contractor need not offer employment on the contract to all service employees on the predecessor contract, but must offer employment only to the number of eligible service employees the successor contractor believes necessary to meet its anticipated staffing pattern. Where a successor contractor does not initially offer employment to all the predecessor contract service employees, the obligation to offer employment shall continue for 90 days after the successor contractorâ€™s first date of performance on the contract. (See 29 CFR 9.12(d) for regulatory provisions addressing circumstances in which reduced staffing can occur.)</p>
