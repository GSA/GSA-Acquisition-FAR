			<p class="- topic/p ">The FAR is the primary regulation for use by all executive agencies in their acquisition of supplies and services with appropriated funds. It became effective on April 1, 1984, and is issued within applicable laws under the joint authorities of the Administrator of General Services, the Secretary of Defense, and the Administrator for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, under the broad policy guidelines of the Administrator, Office of Federal Procurement Policy, Office of Management and Budget.</p>
			<p class="- topic/p ">The FAR precludes agency acquisition regulations that unnecessarily repeat, paraphrase, or otherwise restate the FAR, limits agency acquisition regulations to those necessary to implement FAR policies and procedures within an agency, and provides for coordination, simplicity, and uniformity in the Federal acquisition process. It also provides for agency and public participation in developing the FAR and agency acquisition regulation.</p>
			<p class="- topic/p ">The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) includes all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2019-02. Beginning in fiscal year 2019, designation of Federal Acquisition Circulars was changed to reflect the fiscal year in the first four digits and the sequence of the issued circular in the last two digits.</p>
