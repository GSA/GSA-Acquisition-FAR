is not a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two or
more responsible small business concerns that are competitive in
terms of fair market prices, quality, and delivery. If the contracting
officer receives only one acceptable offer from a responsible small
business concern in response to a set-aside, the contracting officer

no acceptable offers from responsible small business concerns, the

Although past acquisition history and market research of an item or
similar items are always important, these are not the only factors
to be considered in determining whether a reasonable expectation
exists. In making research and development small business set-asides,
there must also be a reasonable expectation of obtaining from small
businesses the best scientific and technological sources consistent
with the demands of the proposed acquisition for the best mix of
cost, performances, and schedules.</ph>

business set-asides other than for construction or services, any
concern proposing to furnish a product that it did not itself manufacture
must furnish the product of a small business manufacturer unless
the SBA has granted either a waiver or exception to the nonmanufacturer
rule (see <xref href="FAR-i1101844.dita#i1101844"
                        base="i1101844"

                        class="- topic/xref ">19.102</xref>(f)). In industries
where the SBA finds that there are no small business manufacturers,
it may issue a waiver to the nonmanufacturer rule (see <xref href="FAR-i1101844.dita#i1101844"
                        base="i1101844"
                        outputclass="fm:ParaNumOnly"
                        class="- topic/xref ">19.102</xref>(f)(4) and (5)).
In addition, SBA has excepted procurements processed under simplified
acquisition procedures (see <xref href="FAR-i1112458.dita#i1112458"
                        base="i1112458"

                        class="- topic/xref ">part  13</xref>),
where the anticipated cost of the procurement will not exceed $25,000,
from the nonmanufacturer rule. Waivers permit small businesses to
provide any firm’s product. The exception permits small businesses
to provide any domestic firm’s product. In both of these cases, the
contracting officer’s determination in paragraph (b)(1) of this
subsection or the decision not to set aside a procurement reserved
for small business under paragraph (a) of this subsection will be
based on the expectation of receiving offers from at least two responsible
small businesses, including nonmanufacturers, offering the products
of different concerns.</p>
