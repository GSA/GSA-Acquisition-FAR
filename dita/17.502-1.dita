to the issuance of a solicitation, the servicing agency and the
requesting agency shall both sign a written interagency agreement
that establishes the general terms and conditions governing the
relationship between the parties, including roles and responsibilities
for acquisition planning, contract execution, and administration
and management of the contract(s) or order(s). The requesting agency
shall provide to the servicing agency any unique terms, conditions,
