                  <i>Research and development (R&amp;D)
advance notices</i>. Contracting officers may transmit to the GPE
advance notices of their interest in potential R&amp;D programs
whenever market research does not produce a sufficient number of
concerns to obtain adequate competition. Advance notices must not
be used where security considerations prohibit such publication. Advance
notices will enable potential sources to learn of R&amp;D programs
and provide these sources with an opportunity to submit information
which will permit evaluation of their capabilities. Contracting
officers must consider potential sources which respond to advance
notices for a subsequent solicitation. Advanced notices must be
entitled "Research and Development Sources Sought" and include the
name and telephone number of the contracting officer or other contracting activity
official from whom technical details of the project can be obtained.
This will enable sources to submit information for evaluation of
their R&amp;D capabilities. Contracting officers must synopsize
